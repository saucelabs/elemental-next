# 🎉 Welcome to Elemental Next! 🚀

In 2023, Team Elemental took Elemental Selenium, which had been untouched for many years, and open sourced the project to enable Selenium users and enthusiasts to contribute directly in opinionated, hands-on ways.

🔥 **Elemental Next** 🔥 is what we are calling the Elemental Selenium revamp -- open sourced, renewed, and ready for community contributions!

# How to Contribute 🙌

There are many ways to contribute to the project -- from adding new tips tutorials, to helping with frontend or backend, or engaging with the community.

For full details on how to contribute, see [CONTRIBUTING.MD](https://github.com/saucelabs/elemental-next/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). 👀

# Running Locally 🏃🏾‍♀️

## Prerequisites

- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 📥
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) `version >= 16` or above (which can be checked by running node -v). You can use nvm for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed 📈

## Installation 💻

- Clone this repo:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/saucelabs/elemental-next
  ```

- Change directory to `frontend`:

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  ```

- Install the dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

# Local Development 🛠️

- Start the website locally:

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

  This command starts a local development server and opens a browser window or tab (http://localhost:3000). Most changes perform live updates to your server without having to refresh your browser.

## Building the Website 🏗️

- Build the website:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  This command gathers the static content and places them in a `build` directory; which is compatible with most static content hosting services.

- Serve the website:

  ```bash
  npm run serve
  ```

  This command builds the site and serves it on your machine's host (http://localhost:3000).

## Deploying the Website 🚀

- Deploy the website:

  ```bash
  npm run deploy -outDir
  ```

🚨 **We are currently deploying this website to GitHub Pages.** 🚨

The <code>docusaurus deploy</code> command helps us deploy our site from the source branch to the deployment branch <code>gh-pages</code> in one command: clone, build, and commit.

The <code>-outDir</code> flag ships only the <code>frontend</code> content folder to the <code>gh-pages</code>.
