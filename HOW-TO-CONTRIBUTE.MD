Welcome to Elemental Selenium 2.0 - The Open Source Project! This is a great opportunity for you to contribute your own Selenium tips from your use cases that will also help others. Ready to contribute? Here's how :

We have included the following content template to allow you to easily add your own tip. Please fill out as much information as you can. Please allow time for your content to be reviewed. Thank you! 

#### Instructions : How To Contribute 
-  Create a new folder for your tip in the tips folder with the following naming convention : [tip number] [tip title] (naming convention should follow kebab-case ex: 1-how-to-upload-a-file). Please do not change the headers, as we use a structured and coherent format to fetch data
-  To create a new folder, use the following tree structure :

#### Project tree
 * [tips](./tips)
 * [1-how-to-upload-a-file](./how-to-upload-a-file)
   * [csharp.md](./how-to-upload-a-file/csharp.md)
   * [java.md](./how-to-upload-a-file/java.md)
   * [javascript.md](./how-to-upload-a-file/javascript.md)
   * [ruby.md](./how-to-upload-a-file/ruby.md)
   * [python.md](./how-to-upload-a-file/python.md)
-  Within the tip folder you create, you will also create MD file for the tip you are adding (ex : javascript.md). You will add your tip contribution to one of the programming languages above - you don't have to add examples for every language
-  Copy the content template below 
-  Fill out the content template with as much of the information listed as you can

#### Keep In Mind 
Use Markdown in order to add code samples, screenshots and links:
- Images : You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in [ ]. Then wrap the link for the image in parentheses ( ) 	
- Links : You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( )
- Code Snippets : You can create a code snippet by adding a backtick to the beginning and end of your code example
