# How to Run a Test on Multiple Browsers

## Intro

You'll occasionally have something that you want to test across multiple browsers. It would be nice to run your test
once and have it execute against all the browsers you care about. Unfortunately this functionality doesn't come out
of the box with most testing frameworks.

## A Solution

With the help of Sauce Labs, a collection, and a loop, we can easily specify a list of browsers and run a test
against each of them.

Let's take a look at an example.


import DisplayTips from "../../src/components/displayTips";

<DisplayTips contentPath={"41-one-test-multiple-browsers"} languages={[
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby' },
]} />
