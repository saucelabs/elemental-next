# How To Handle Exceptions

## Intro

It doesn't take long when using Selenium before you run into errors from Selenium that may seem inexplicable
(e.g., `NoSuchElementError` or `StaleElementReferenceError`). They can be a bit of a shock if you're not sure
what they are, how to handle them, or where to find documentation on how to address them.

## A Solution

By adding some simple exception handling we can catch Selenium's errors and make our tests more resilient.

Let's take a look at an example.


import DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';

<DisplayTips contentPath={"44-exception-handling"} languages={[
    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},
]}/>
