# SafariDriver

## Intro

Since Selenium 2.45.0, in order to use SafariDriver, you need to manually install the SafariDriver browser extension.

## A Solution

Running your Selenium tests on a different browser tends to require additional setup, and [SafariDriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/SafariDriver) is no
exception.

The following example will go through how to do it and make sure it's working.



import DisplayTips from "../../src/components/displayTips";
const contentLanguages = [
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java' },
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby' },
];

<DisplayTips contentPath={"69-safari"} languages={contentLanguages} />
