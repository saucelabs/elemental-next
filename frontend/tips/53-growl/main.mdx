# How to Add Growl Notifications to Your Tests

## Intro

Good test reports are a fundamental component of successful test automation, but running down a test failure by
looking at a test report can be a real pain sometimes. Oftentimes, you're left to decipher debug statements, or
go through things piece by piece -- all for the sake of trying to track down a transient issue.

## A Solution

By leveraging something like [jQuery Growl](http://ksylvest.github.io/jquery-growl/) you can output non-interactive debugging statements directly to
the page you're testing.

With Growl way you can see helpful information and more-likely correlate it to the test actions that are being
taken. This can a boon for your test runs when coupled with screenshots and/or video recordings of your test runs

Let's step through an example of how to set this up.



import DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';

<DisplayTips contentPath={"53-growl"} languages={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'python' },
    { label: 'C#', value: 'csharp' },
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java' },
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript' },
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby' },
]} />
