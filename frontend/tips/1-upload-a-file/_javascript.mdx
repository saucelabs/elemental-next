## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries

Lines 1 to 3 are pulling in our requisite classes for interacting with the operating system (e.g., `require("path");`),
our testing framework (e.g., `mocha` and `require("assert")`), and driving the browser with
Selenium (e.g., `const {Builder, By} = require("selenium-webdriver");`).

### Setup and Teardown

After creating a `describe` to group our tests (e.g., `describe("Upload Test")...`), lines 8 to 14 are setting up and
tearing down the browser instance.

The `beforeEach` method, will execute before each test. In it, we are launching a new instance of Firefox with
Selenium and storing it in a class variable that we'll use throughout all tests. After our test executes the second
method, `afterEach`, will execute. This calls `driver.quit()` which ends the session by closing the browser instance.

### The Test

Lines 17 to 25 are the test itself.

After declaring the test method (e.g., `it("upload a file")...`) we specify the name of file we'd like to upload. It's
a text file called `some-file.txt` in the current working directory. We determine the path to this file and store it
in a variable called `filePath`.

Next we visit the page with the upload form, input the string value of `filePath`, and click the submit button on the
form. After the file is uploaded to the page it will display the filename it just processed. We use this text on the
page to perform our assertion (making sure the uploaded file is what we expect).

### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `package.json` file.

<details>
    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>package.json</code> file.</summary>
    <div>
        <TipCode codePath={"1-upload-a-file/code/javascript/package.json"} language={"json"}/>
    </div>
</details>

Finally, we can run the test by executing `npm test` from the command-line.
