# How to Use Selenium Grid

## Intro

If you're looking to run your tests on different browser and operating system combinations but you're unable to
justify using a third-party solution like [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) then what do you do?

## A Solution

With [Selenium Grid](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/grid/) you can stand up a simple infrastructure of various browsers on different operating systems
to not only distribute test load, but also give you a diversity of browsers to work with.

> A brief primer of Selenium Grid
>
> Selenium Grid is part of [the Selenium project](https://www.selenium.dev/). It lets you distribute test execution across several
> machines. You can connect to it with a remote WebDriver by specifying the browser, browser version, and operating
> system you want. You specify these values through Selenium `Capabilities`.
>
> There are two main elements to Selenium Grid -- a Hub, and Nodes. First you need to stand up a Hub. Then you can
> connect (or "register") Nodes to that Hub.
> Nodes are where your tests will run, and the Hub is responsible for making sure your tests end up on the right
> one (e.g., the machine with the operating system and browser you specified in your test).


Let's continue with an example.
