## Example

To start things off let's include our requisite classes for our test framework (e.g., `NUnit.Framework`), driving the browser with Selenium (e.g., `OpenQA.Selenium`, etc.), an HTTP library to handle our HEAD request (e.g., `System.Net`), and start our class with some setup and teardown methods.

```csharp
// filename: FileDownloadRevisited.cs
using NUnit.Framework;
using OpenQA.Selenium;
using OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox;
using System.Net;

public class FileDownloadRevisited
{

    IWebDriver Driver;

    [SetUp]
    public void SetUp()
    {
        Driver = new FirefoxDriver();
    }

    [TearDown]
    public void TearDown()
    {
        Driver.Quit();
    }
// ...
```

Now we're ready to wire up our test.

It's just a simple matter of visiting the page with download links, grabbing a URL from one of them, and performing a `HEAD` request with it.

```csharp
// filename: FileDownloadRevisited.cs
// ...
    [Test]
    public void CheckFileDownloadWithoutBrowser()
    {
        Driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/download");
        string FileURL = Driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector(".example a")).GetAttribute("href");
        var Request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(FileURL);
        Request.Method = "HEAD";
        WebResponse Response = Request.GetResponse();
        Assert.That(Response.ContentType.Equals("application/octet-stream"));
        Assert.Greater(Response.ContentLength, 0);
    }
}
```

Once we receive the response we check its header for the content type (e.g., `Assert.That(Response.ContentType.Equals("application/octet-stream"));`) and content length (e.g., `Assert.Greater(Response.ContentLength, 0);`) to make sure the file is the correct type and not empty.

## Expected Behavior

When you save this and run it (e.g., `nunit3-console.exe .\FileDownloadRevisited.sln` from the command-line) here is what will happen:

- Open the browser
- Load the page
- Grab the URL of the first download link
- Perform a `HEAD` request against it with an HTTP library
- Store the response headers
- Check the response headers to see that the file type is correct
- Check the response headers to see that the file is not empty
- Close the browser

## Summary

Compared to the browser specific configuration with Selenium this is hands-down a leaner, faster, and more maintainable approach.

Happy Testing!
