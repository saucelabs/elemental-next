# How to Simulate Slow Connections

## Intro

With Selenium, you have the luxury of cross browser testing. But what happens when you also need to test how
your application behaves on a _slow_ connection?

## A Solution

With the help of a proxy server like [BrowserMob Proxy](http://bmp.lightbody.net/) we can simulate bandwidth limitations and run our
tests to see if they fall down. In order to do this we'll also need to adjust our Selenium's default timeout.

>### A Brief Primer on BrowserMob ProxyBrowserMob Proxy is a server which sits between your browser and the application you're testing. You connectto it by configuring a browser profile to pass through it. As listed on[the BrowserMob Proxy GitHub page](https://github.com/lightbody/browsermob-proxy#features-and-usage), here are someof the benefits it offers:+ blacklisting and whitelisting certain URL patterns+ simulating various bandwidth and latency+ remapping DNS lookups+ flushing DNS caching+ controlling DNS and request timeouts+ automatic BASIC authorization

__NOTE:__ You can also capture HTTP status codes with it as well. See [tip 17](/tips/17-retrieve-http-status-codes) for details on how to do that.

Let's continue with an example.
