## Example

For our initial setup let's pull in our requisite libraries (`import unittest` for our test framework, `from selenium import webdriver` to drive the browser, and `import time` to add a delay in our script, so we're able to see the notification messages), declare our test class, and wire up some test `setUp` and `tearDown` methods.

```python
# filename: highlight_elements.py
import unittest
from selenium import webdriver
import time
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

class HighlightElements(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Firefox()

    def tearDown(self):
        self.driver.quit()

# ...
```

Now let's create a `highlight` helper method that will accept a Selenium WebDriver `element` and a time to wait (e.g., `duration`) as arguments.

By setting a duration, we can control how long to highlight an element on the page before reverting the styling back. And we can make this an optional argument by setting a default value for it (e.g., 3 seconds).

```python
# filename: highlight_elements.py
# ...
    def highlight(self, element, duration=3):
        driver = self.driver

        # Store original style so it can be reset later
        original_style = element.get_attribute("style")

        # Style element with dashed red border
        driver.execute_script(
            "arguments[0].setAttribute(arguments[1], arguments[2])",
            element,
            "style",
            "border: 2px solid red; border-style: dashed;")

        # Keep element highlighted for a spell and then revert
        if (duration > 0):
            time.sleep(duration)
            driver.execute_script(
                "arguments[0].setAttribute(arguments[1], arguments[2])",
                element,
                "style",
                original_style)

# ...
```

There are three things going on here.

1. We store the style of the element, so we can revert it back when we're done
2. We change the style of the element, so it visually stands out (e.g., a red dashed border)
3. We revert the style of the element back after 3 seconds

We're accomplishing the style change through JavaScript's `setAttribute` function. And we're executing it with Selenium's `execute_script` command.

Now to use this in our test is simple, we just prepend a `find_element` command with a call to the `highlight` method.

```python
# filename: highlight_element.py
# ...
    def test_example_1(self):
        driver = self.driver
        driver.get('http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/large')
        self.highlight(driver.find_element(By.ID,'sibling-2.3'))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

## Expected Behavior

When we save this file and run it (e.g., `python highlight_elements.py` from the command-line) here is what will happen.

- Browser opens
- Load the page
- Find the element
- Change the styling of the element, so it has a red dashed-line border
- Wait 3 seconds
- Revert the styling to remove the border
- Browser closes

## Summary

If you wanted to take this a step further, you could leverage this approach along with an interactive debugger.

Alternatively, you could verify your locators by using a browser plugin like FireFinder.

Happy Testing!
