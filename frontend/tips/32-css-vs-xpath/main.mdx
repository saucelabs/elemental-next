## Intro

One of the most heated and subjective conversations in the Selenium community is which locator strategy is better,
often circling around two -- XPath and CSS. People in favor of CSS say that it is more readable and faster
(especially when running against Internet Explorer). While those in favor of XPath tout its ability to transverse
the page (while CSS cannot).

With such a divide, it can be hard to determine the best approach for you and your team. Especially when most
of these claims are outdated.

## A Solution

Let's cut through the noise by running our own performance tests across all major browsers to see how CSS and
XPath stack up and fall down. Then we will be able to determine a more helpful locator strategy.
