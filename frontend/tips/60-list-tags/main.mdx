# How to Generate a List of Tags from Your Tests

## Intro

Tagging is a powerful tool for targeted test execution, as well as a lightweight form of documentation. But what
happens when you want to see a summary of the tags you're using across all of your tests? Unfortunately, most
solution don't offer this kind of functionality out of the box, leaving you to manually sift through your tests
to get a sense of the different tags you're using.

## A Solution

By leveraging the before and after hooks in our test framework, we can interrogate each test in one fell swoop to
get the tags and generate a simple report.

Here is an example.


import DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';

<DisplayTips languages={[
    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},
]}/>
