# How to Create a Data-driven Test

## Intro

There are times when you run across functionality you want to test repeatedly with various inputs to see how the
system behaves. We're going to go over a way to do this that will take some of the burden out of the process.

Sometimes performing these tests are because you want to test the expected outcomes. Other times, because you
want to see if the system breaks in an odd way. But, wiring up all of these permutations into a set of automated
tests can be burdensome and rife with copied code, which can make it hard to maintain over time.

## A Solution

Enter Data-driven Testing.

By storing your desired inputs and expected outcomes in a central repository of some kind (e.g. a comma separated
file, database, etc) you can easily wire up tests to use each of them instead of writing numerous tests and
hard-coding these values directly in your test code.
