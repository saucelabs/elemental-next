# Where to Look for Selenium Information

## Intro

There is an abundance of information and resources when it comes to Selenium.

Although Selenium information is out there, it can be challenging to sift through all of it, or to even know where
to look for it. If you're struggling with an issue and need help with a solution, access to these resources and
communities can be especially essential.

## A Solution

Here is a comprehensive list showing many of the Selenium resources available and what they are useful for.

## Available Resources

### Documentation & Tips

+ [Selenium Documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/)

This is the official Selenium documentation site. There is a lot of helpful information here. Use the sidebar
menu on the left to navigate. Each documentation article is dated at the bottom to show when it was last modified,
and the site seems to be kept fairly updated.

+ [The Selenium Wiki](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/wiki)

There is a lot of great stuff in this wiki -- mainly, documentation about the various language bindings and browser
drivers. If you're not already familiar with it, take a look. It is kept very up-to-date by volunteer contributors
who have donated thousands of hours in upkeep and code development.

+ [Hands-On Selenium WebDriver with Java - The Repo](https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-webdriver-java)

This is an open-source project created and maintained by [Boni Garcia](https://twitter.com/boni_gg). It contains a comprehensive collection
of examples about Selenium 4 using Java as language binding. These examples are explained in Boni's book mentioned
below in the Books section.

### Books

+ [Hands-On Selenium WebDriver with Java - The Book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-selenium-webdriver/9781098109998/)

This book is by [Boni Garcia](https://twitter.com/boni_gg) and it is a thorough resource. It outlines how to use Selenium, top-to-bottom,
using Java, and is a great resource to keep handy.

### Meetups

+ [All Selenium Meetups listed on Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/find/?keywords=selenium&source=EVENTS)

A listing of all in-person Selenium Meetups are available on Meetup.com. If you're near a major city, odds are
there's one waiting for you.

### Conferences

+ [Selenium Conf](https://seleniumconf.com/)

This is the annual conference where practitioners and Selenium Core Committers gather and share knowledge. All of
the talks are top notch, as is the hallway track. If I were to attend just one conference a year, it would be this one.

+ [Selenium Camp](https://seleniumcamp.com/)

This is a self-organized Selenium conference that's held annually in Kiev, Ukraine. It's a well organized event
with some great talks. It's the most advanced test automation conference I've attended. Definitely worth the trip.

### Videos

+ [Selenium Conference Talks](http://www.youtube.com/user/seleniumconf/videos)

Every year talks from The Selenium Conference are recorded and made freely available online. This is one of the
best resources around.

+ [Selenium Meetup Talks](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL67l1VPxOnT4BwuKRmt_INeMd0_jtUhDt)

Some Selenium Meetups take it upon themselves to record their talks and publish them afterwards. Here are some of
them. They are a great way to see what other pockets of the community are up to (outside of the annual Selenium Conf).

### Mailing Lists

+ [Selenium Users Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/selenium-users)
+ [Selenium LinkedIn Users Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/961927/)

These groups are fairly large, and it can be challenging at times to find what you're looking for. Even so, you can
occasionally find some unique insights and answers to your questions.

### Forums

+ [Quora](http://www.quora.com/Selenium-testing-framework)
+ [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/)
+ [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/selenium)

These are amazing community forums where you can go look for answers to questions you have regarding Selenium.
The forums are populated by community members who volunteer their time and expertise to answer questions and help
troubleshoot towards solutions.

### Issues

+ [Selenium Issue Tracker](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/issues)

If you're running into a specific and repeatable issue that just doesn't make sense, you may have found a bug in
Selenium. You'll want to check the Selenium Issue Tracker to see if it has already been reported. If not, then create
a new issue. But be sure to read [this post](http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2012/12/not-providing-html-page-is-bogus.html) before you do (so you can be sure that you've provided enough
information for the Core Committers to work on it).

## Summary

As you can see there's a lot out there. But hopefully this list has helped guide you to the best resources for
your context.

Happy Testing!
