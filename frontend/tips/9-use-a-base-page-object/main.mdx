# Using a Base Page Object

## Intro

In a previous tip, we went through creating a simple Page Object to capture the behavior of a page we were interacting
with. While this was a good start, it leaves a lot of room for improvement. One of the biggest issues is that there
are common actions we will likely need across multiple Page Objects and, with our current approach, we would end up
with duplicate code.

Another issue is that we are using Selenium actions directly in the Page Object, which could present some long-term
impacts like, such as:
+ the inability to drive your tests with a different driver
+ test maintenance issues when Selenium actions change
+ slower test writing due to the lack of a Domain Specific Language (DSL)

## A Solution

With a Base Page Object (a.k.a. a facade layer) we can abstract all common actions into a central location and
leverage them in any Page Object we see fit.
