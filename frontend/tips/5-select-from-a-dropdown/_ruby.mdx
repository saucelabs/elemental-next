## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries, Setup and Teardown

We'll first need to pull in our requisite libraries (`selenium-webdriver` to drive the browser, and
`rspec/expecations` & `RSpec::Matchers` to perform our assertions) and wire up some simple `setup`, `teardown`,
and `run` methods.

### Example 1

After visiting [the example application](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dropdown) we find the dropdown list by its ID and store it in a variable. We
then find each clickable element in the dropdown list (e.g., each `option`) with `find_elements`.

Grabbing all the options returns a collection that we iterate over and when the text matches what we want it will
click on it.

We finish the test by performing a check to see that our selection was made correctly. This is done by reiterating
over the dropdown options collection one more time. This time we're getting the text of the item that was selected,
storing it in a variable, and making an assertion against it.

While this works, there is a more accessible way to do this.

### Example 2

Similar to the first example, we are finding the dropdown list by its ID. Instead of iterating over its option
elements and clicking based on a conditional check, we are leveraging a built-in helper function of Selenium,
[`Select`](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/Support/Select.html), and it's [`select_by`](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/Support/Select.html#select_by-instance_method) method to choose the item we want.

We then ask the `select_list` what option was selected by using the [`selected_options`](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/Support/Select.html#selected_options-instance_method) method. This returns
an array of Selenium Elements (which in this case is an array of just one element). So we need to reference the
first element by it's index (e.g., `[0]`), ask for it's text, and store it in a variable (e.g., `selected_option`).

Then we perform our assertion against this variable (just like in the previous example).

In addition to selecting by text, you can also select by value.

```ruby
    select_list.select_by(:value, '1')
```

### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `Gemfile` file.

    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>Gemfile</code> file.</summary>
    <div>
        <TipCode codePath={"5-select-from-a-dropdown/code/ruby/Gemfile"} language={"txt"}/>
    </div>
</details>

Finally, we can run the test by executing `ruby dropdown.rb` from the command-line.
