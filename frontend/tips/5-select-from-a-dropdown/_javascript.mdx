## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries, Setup and Teardown

The first two lines are pulling in our testing framework (e.g., `require("assert")`), driving the
browser with Selenium (e.g., `const {Builder, By} = require("selenium-webdriver");`). Then we wire up
some test setup and teardown methods.


### Example 1

Our first example is `select the hard way`, after visiting [the example application](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dropdown) we find the dropdown list
by its ID and store it in a variable. We then find each clickable element in the dropdown list
(e.g., each `option`) with `findElements`.

Grabbing all options returns a collection that we iterate over and when the text matches what we want it
will click on it.

We finish the test by performing a check to see that our selection was made correctly. This is done by looping
over the dropdown options collection one more time. This time we're getting the text of the item that was
selected, storing it in a variable, and then making an assertion against it.

While this works, there is a more accessible way to do this.

### Example 2

Our second example is `select the simpler way`, and similar to the first example, we are selecting a dropdown
list option by its text. Instead of first finding the dropdown list, we will employ a more robust locator
(e.g., XPath) to find an element within the dropdown list that contains our target text -- and click it.

We then determine what has been selected in the dropdown list by using one more powerful locator (e.g., a
CSS selector). This time, looking to see which option has the `selected` attribute, and grabbing its text. We
use this found text to assert that the correct item was chosen.

### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `package.json` file.

<details>
    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>package.json</code> file.</summary>
    <div>
        <TipCode codePath={"5-select-from-a-dropdown/code/javascript/package.json"} language={"json"}/>
    </div>
</details>

Finally, we can run the test by executing `npm test` from the command-line.
