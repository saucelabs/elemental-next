## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries, Setup and Teardown

First let's import our requisite classes (for annotations (e.g., `org.junit.After`, etc.), driving the
browser with Selenium (e.g., `org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver`, etc.), and matchers for our assertions
(e.g., `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions`, etc.)), and start our class with some setup and teardown
methods.

Next, we'll start our class off with some setup and teardown methods.

### Example 1

Our first example is `dropdownTest`, after visiting [the example application](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dropdown) we find the dropdown list by
its ID and store it in a variable. We then find each clickable element in the dropdown list (e.g., each `option`)
with `findElements` (note the plural).

Grabbing all options with `findElements` returns a collection that we iterate over. When the text matches
what we want, we click on it.

We finish the test by performing a check to see that our selection was made correctly. This is done by iterating
over the dropdown options collection one more time. This time we're getting the text of the item that was selected,
storing it in a variable, and making an assertion against it.

While this works, there is a more accessible way to do this.

### Example 2

Our second example is `dropdownTestRedux`, and similar to the first example, we are finding the dropdown list by
its ID. But instead of iterating over its option elements and clicking based on a conditional we are leveraging
a built-in helper function of Selenium. With [`Select`](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/Select.html) and it's `selectBy` methods
(e.g., [`selectByVisibleText`](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/Select.html#selectByVisibleText-java.lang.String-)) we're able to easily choose the item we want.

We then ask the `selectList` what option was selected by using [`getFirstSelectedOption`](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/Select.html#getFirstSelectedOption--) and perform our
assertion against it's text.

As an aside, in addition to selecting by text you can also select by value.

```java
    select.selectByValue("1");
```

### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `pom.xml` file.

<details>
    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>pom.xml</code> file.</summary>
    <div>
        <TipCode codePath={"5-select-from-a-dropdown/code/java/pom.xml"} language={"xml"}/>
    </div>
</details>

Finally, we can run the test by executing `mvn test` from the command-line.
