## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries, Setup and Teardown

The first few lines are pulling in our requisite classes for our testing framework
(e.g., `using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;`), driving the browser with Selenium
(e.g., `using OpenQA.Selenium;`), launching an instance of Firefox (e.g., `using OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox;`),
and Selenium's wait functions (e.g., `using OpenQA.Selenium.Support.UI;`), and access to C# collections
(e.g., `System.Collections.Generic`).

Next, we'll start our class off with some setup and teardown methods, covered in the following lines.

### Example 1

Our first example is `SelectFromDropdownTheHardWay`. After visiting [the example application](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dropdown) we find the
dropdown list by its ID and store it in a variable. We then find each element in the dropdown list (e.g., each
element with an `option` tag) with `FindElements` (note the plural).

Grabbing all options with `FindElements` returns a collection that we iterate over. When the text matches
what we want (e.g., `"Option 1"`) we click on it.

We finish the test by performing a check to see that our selection was made correctly. This is done by iterating
over the dropdown options collection once more. This time we're getting the text of the item that was selected,
storing it in a variable, and making an assertion against it.

While this works, there is a simpler, built-in way to do this with Selenium. Let's give that a go.

### Example 2

Our second example is `SelectFromDropdownTheEasyWay`, and similar to the first example, we are finding the dropdown
list by its ID. But instead of iterating over its option elements and clicking based on a conditional we are
leveraging a built-in helper function of Selenium. With [`SelectElement`](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/T_OpenQA_Selenium_Support_UI_SelectElement.htm) and its `SelectBy` methods
(e.g., [`SelectByText`](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/M_OpenQA_Selenium_Support_UI_SelectElement_SelectByText.htm)) we're able to easily choose the item we want.

We then perform our assertion against the text of the currently selected option
(e.g., `Assert.AreEqual("Option 1", Dropdown.SelectedOption.Text)`).

As an aside, in addition to selecting by text you can also select by value.

```csharp
    Dropdown.SelectByValue("1");
```

### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the project file (e.g.,
`csharp.csproj` in this case).

<details>
    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>csharp.csproj</code> file.</summary>
    <div>
        <TipCode codePath={"5-select-from-a-dropdown/code/csharp/csharp.csproj"} language={"xml"}/>
    </div>
</details>

Finally, we can run the test by executing `dotnet test` from the command-line.
