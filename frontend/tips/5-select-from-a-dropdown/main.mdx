# How to Select from a Dropdown List

## Intro

Some common use cases for selecting from a dropdown list might be selecting sizes or styles from a dropdown
menu while online shopping, or selecting your method of payment. And, while selecting from a dropdown list
might *seem* straightforward -- just grab the list by its element and select an item within it, based on the
text you want -- there's a bit more skill to it.

Let's take a look at a couple of different approaches.

import DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';

<DisplayTips contentPath={"5-select-from-a-dropdown"} languages={[
    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},
    {label: 'C#', value: 'csharp'},
    {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},
    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript'},
    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},
]}/>
