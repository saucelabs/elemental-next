## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries, Setup and Teardown

The first lines are pulling in our requisite libraries our testing framework (e.g., `import pytest`),
driving the browser with Selenium (e.g., `from selenium import webdriver`), and a locator strategy to
find the elements (e.g. `from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By`), and wire up some setup and
teardown methods for our tests.

### Example 1

After visiting [the example application](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dropdown) we find the dropdown list by its ID and store it in a variable. We
then find each clickable element in the dropdown list (e.g., each `option`) with `find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, 'option')`.

Grabbing all options returns a collection that we iterate over and when the text matches what we want it
will click on it.

We finish the test by performing a check to see that our selection was made correctly. This is done by reiterating
over the dropdown options collection one more time. This time we're getting the text of the item that was
selected, storing it in a variable, and making an assertion against it.

While this works, there is a simpler, built-in way to do this with Selenium. Let's give that a go.

### Example 2

Similar to the first example, we are finding the dropdown list by its ID. But instead of iterating over its option
elements and clicking based on a conditional check, we are leveraging a built-in helper function of Selenium,
[`Select`](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py/webdriver_support/selenium.webdriver.support.select.html#module-selenium.webdriver.support.select), and its [`select_by_visibile_text`](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py/webdriver_support/selenium.webdriver.support.select.html#selenium.webdriver.support.select.Select.select_by_visible_text) method to choose the item we want.

We then ask the `select_list` what option was selected by using the [`first_selected_option`](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py/webdriver_support/selenium.webdriver.support.select.html#selenium.webdriver.support.select.Select.first_selected_option) method. This
returns a Selenium Element that we grab the text from, storing it in a variable (e.g., `selected_option`).

Then we perform our assertion against this variable (just like in the previous example).

In addition to selecting by text, you can also select by value.

```python
    select_list.select_by_value('1')
```

### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to install the required libraries. We can do this by running
`pip install -r requirements.txt` from the command-line. The `requirements.txt` file contains the libraries we
need to install.

<details>
    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>requirements.txt</code> file.</summary>
    <div>
        <TipCode codePath={"5-select-from-a-dropdown/code/python/requirements.txt"} language={"txt"}/>
    </div>
</details>

After installing the required libraries, we can run the test by executing `pytest dropdown.py` from the command-line.
