# How to Do Performance Testing

## Intro

Odds are pretty good that your production application has some kind of performance monitoring in place (e.g., New
Relic). This goes a long way towards identifying when something detrimental has been released into the wild.

But how do you catch performance issues before they reach production?

## A Solution

By repurposing a Selenium script, we can run it through a proxy server and capture the HTTP traffic. With this
traffic, we can run some simple checks to see if the application's performance has degraded.

Let's dig in with an example.



import DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';

<DisplayTips contentPath={"49-performance-testing"} languages={[
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby' },
]} />
