# How to Run Your Tests Headless with Xvfb

## Intro

If you want to run your tests headless on a Continuous Integration (CI) server you'll quickly realize that you
can't with an out-of-the-box setup since there is no display output for the browser to launch in.

## A Solution

In order to run your tests using a browser that's loaded on your CI Server you will need to configure your tests
to launch the browser virtually (e.g., using something like Xvfb).

>### An Xvfb primer
>
>[Xvfb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb) (short for X virtual framebuffer) is an in-memory display server for
> UNIX-like operating system (e.g., Linux). It enables you to run graphical applications without a display
> (e.g., browser tests on a CI server) while also having the ability to take screenshots.

Let's take a look at an example.


import DisplayTips from "../../src/components/displayTips";

<DisplayTips contentPath={"38-headless"} languages={[
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby' },
]} />
