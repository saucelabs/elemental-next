# How to Run a Test on Multiple Browsers, In Parallel

## Intro

In the previous tip I covered how to run a single test against multiple browsers. While this could come in handy,
it is still a bit lacking.

Right now, the test is only being run one at a time (a.k.a. in series) for each browser in our list. If this were
a longer running test and/or if there were more browsers we cared about, then this could quickly stack up to longer
test run times.

## A Solution

Let's remedy this by taking [the previous tip's example](https://elementalselenium.com/docs/one-test-multiple-browsers/41-one-test-multiple-browsers)
and parallelize it with the help of [threads](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_multithreading.htm).
