# How to Test For Disabled Elements

## Intro

On occasion you may have the need to check if an element on a page is disabled or enabled. Unfortunately, this is not
a well-documented function of Selenium, so doing a trivial action like this can quickly become a pain.

## A Solution

If we look at [the API documentation for Selenium's IWebElement Interface](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/T_OpenQA_Selenium_IWebElement.htm) we can see there is an available
method called `Enabled` that can help us accomplish what we want.

Let's take a look at how to use it.


import DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';

<DisplayTips contentPath={"40-disabled-element"} languages={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'python' },
    { label: 'C#', value: 'csharp' },
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java' },
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript' },
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby' },
]} />
