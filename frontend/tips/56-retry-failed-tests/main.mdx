# How to Automatically Retry Failed Tests

## Intro

You want reliable tests. But no matter how hard you try, you're going to run into intermittent test failures.
These can be frustrating time wasters that distract you and your team and begin to erode the trust placed in the
automated tests. Once that begins, it's a slippery slope.

## A Solution

Rather than rerun your entire test suite to suss out transient failures -- you can log which tests fail, and retry
just those a second time.

Let's continue with an example.


import DisplayTips from "../../src/components/displayTips";
const contentLanguages = [
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby' },
];

<DisplayTips contentPath={"56-retry-failed-tests"} languages={contentLanguages} />
