# How To Run Your Tests Headlessly with Chrome

## Intro

> This is a guest post from [Chris Kenst](https://twitter.com/ckenst).

If you want to run your tests headlessly on a Continuous Integration (CI) server you'll quickly realize that you can't with an out-of-the-box setup since there is no display output for the browser to launch in. You could use a third party library like Xvfb or PhantomJS but those can be hard to install and aren't guaranteed to be supported in the long run (like PhantomJS).
