# How To Run Your Tests Headless with Chrome

## Intro

> This is a guest post from [Chris Kenst](https://twitter.com/ckenst).

If you want to run your tests headlessly on a Continuous Integration (CI) server you'll quickly realize that you
can't with an out-of-the-box setup since there is no display output for the browser to launch in. You could use a
third party library like Xvfb or PhantomJS but those can be hard to install and aren't guaranteed to be supported
in the long run (like PhantomJS).

## A Solution

Enter Headless Chrome ([link](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md))

Starting with Chrome 59 (Chrome 60 for Windows) we can pass Chrome a few configuration options to enable headless mode.


import DisplayTips from "../../src/components/displayTips";
const contentLanguages = [
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby' },
];

<DisplayTips contentPath={"72-headless-chrome"} languages={contentLanguages} />
