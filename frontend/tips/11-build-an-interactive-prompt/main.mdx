# Building an Interactive Prompt

## Intro

Working with Selenium straight in code has its advantages. However, if you run into a complicated scenario to automate,
it becomes challenging to work through it to completion.

The typical approach is to walk through the scenario manually and inspect its markup, identify the parts you want to
interact with, write up the test script, run it, and watch it. If it passes, then pat yourself on the back. If it
fails, make some tweaks and run it again -- repeating until it passes.

This is a real pain, and it's even more frustrating when debugging tests that fail intermittently.

## A Solution

One way to simplify things, and make it easier for testers to transition from Selenium IDE, is to build an interactive
prompt -- also known as a read-eval-print-loop (REPL).

Upon loading the prompt it will launch a browser and accept Selenium commands just the same as they are written in
test code. And if a command is issued that errors (or that it doesn't recognize) the prompt will provide that
information and continue to function.

This will enable us to continue through specific Selenium actions and locators to verify that they work before
putting them into test code.
