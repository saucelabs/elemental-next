# Building an Interactive Prompt

## Intro

Working with Selenium straight in code has its advantages. However, if you run into a complicated scenario to automate, it becomes challenging to work through it to completion.

The typical approach is to walk through the scenario manually and inspect its markup, identify the parts you want to interact with, write up the test script, run it, and watch it. If it passes, then pat yourself on the back. If it fails, make some tweaks and run it again -- repeating until it passes.

This is a real pain, and it's even more frustrating when debugging tests that fail intermittently.
