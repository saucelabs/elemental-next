# How to Test Your Mobile App

## Intro

__NOTE: This post is outdated. I've written a more current series of getting started posts for mobile testing
with Appium. You can find them [here](https://saucelabs.com/resources/articles/appium-bootcamp-chapter-1).__

## Use Case

Mobile is kind of a big deal. And if you haven't needed to test a mobile app yet, it's only a matter of time.
But where do you start? And how do you do it in a way that is complimentary to your existing automation and experience?

## A Solution

Give [Appium](https://appium.io/) a try. It's open source, works for both iPhone & Android, and works through the use
of the Selenium WebDriver API (without having to recompile the app in order to test it).

That is to say -- you can write tests pretty much the same way as you do now, there are just some additional things
to think about -- like new functionality (e.g. pinch, swipe, etc.) and setup (e.g. serving your app, running
simulators and a server locally, or sending things off to the cloud).

To simplify things, let's step through 2 examples using Sauce Labs to test native apps -- one for iPhone and
another for Android. If you need a primer on what Sauce Labs is and how to use it, check out
[this tip](https://elementalselenium.com/docs/cloud/26-cloud).

__NOTE: These examples were borrowed from
[the Appium project](https://github.com/appium/appium/tree/master/sample-code/examples/ruby) and modified for simplicity.__
