# How to Upload a File

## Intro

Uploading a file is a common piece of functionality found on the web but when trying to automate it, you get prompted
with a dialog box that is just out of reach for Selenium.

In these cases people often look to a third-party tool to manipulate this window (e.g., [AutoIt](http://www.toolsqa.com/selenium-webdriver/autoit-selenium-webdriver/)). While this
can help solve your short-term need, it sets you up for failure later by chaining you to a specific platform (e.g.,
AutoIt only works on Windows), effectively limiting your ability to test this functionality on different browser &
operating system combinations.

## A Solution

A work-around for this problem is to side-step the system dialog box entirely. We can do this by using Selenium to
insert the full path of the file we want to upload (as text) into the form and then submit the form.

Let's step through an example.


import DisplayTips from "../../src/components/displayTips";

<DisplayTips contentPath={"1-how-to-upload-a-file"} languages={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'python' },
    { label: 'C#', value: 'csharp' },
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java' },
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript' },
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby' },
]} />
