# How to Test Checkboxes

## Intro

Checkboxes are an often used element in web applications. This guide will show you how to work with them in your
Selenium tests.

Intuitively you may reach for a method that has the word 'checked' in it -- like `.checked` or `.is_checked` but
this doesn't exist in Selenium.

## A Solution

There are two ways to approach this issue -- by seeing if an element has a `checked` attribute (a.k.a. performing
an attribute lookup), or by asking an element if it has been _selected_.

We're going to go through each of these approaches to see their pros and cons.
