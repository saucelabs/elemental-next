# How to Test HTML5 Drag and Drop

## Intro

Exercising a page's drag-and-drop functionality used to be simple with [Selenium's Action Builder](http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/ActionBuilder.html), but sadly,
[it won't work with HTML5 drag and drop](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=6315).

## A Solution

As a workaround, we can simulate dragging and dropping by executing JavaScript with Selenium. Let's continue with an
example.


import DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';

<DisplayTips contentPath={"39-drag-and-drop"} languages={[
    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},
]}/>
