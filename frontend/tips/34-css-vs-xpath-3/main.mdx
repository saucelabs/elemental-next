# CSS vs. XPath, Conclusion

>**NOTE: This is part 3 of 3. For the first installment, [go here](https://elementalselenium.com/docs/css-vs-xpath/32-css-vs-xpath).

## Intro

In [the last tip](https://elementalselenium.com/docs/css-vs-xpath-2/33-css-vs-xpath-2) I provided benchmarks that
showed XPath and CSS performance across various browsers. Since then I've received feedback on some things that my
test was missing -- most notably more browser coverage (e.g., Internet Explorer 9 and 10) and testing against a
larger and deeper page.

## A Solution

In order to make sure these benchmarks are as thorough as possible I've put together
[an example that demonstrates a large and deep page](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/large), and retooled
[my test script](https://github.com/diemol/selenium-benchmark/blob/master/lib/page-objects/large_dom.rb) accordingly.
Otherwise, everything is pretty much the same as last time (e.g., dual runs to weed out anomalies, 100 test executions
for time in seconds, etc.).

Let's dig into the results.
