# How to Filter Test Results with Tags

## Intro

As your test suite grows you'll likely employ some kind of folder structure to help make sense of everything --
grouping similar tests together. But what do you do when you want to run a set of tests that span across your
organizational structure? Especially when your organizational structure isn't set in stone?

## A Solution

By applying some metadata to your tests, you can specify a filter at runtime to execute a focused group of tests,
returning just the ones you want.

Here are some tagging ideas to help get you started:

+ `wip` (e.g., work in progress)
+ `smoke` (e.g., smoke tests)
+ `moneymakers` (e.g., the user paths that correlate to the bottom line of the business)
+ `component name`
+ `story number` (e.g., traceability to your development stories)

Let's start with an example.
