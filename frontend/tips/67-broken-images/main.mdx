# How to Test for Broken Images

## Intro

Selenium is built to mimic human action (e.g., clicking, typing, dragging, dropping, etc.). So how do you use it to
test for broken images?

## A Solution

Out of the box, Selenium is not equipped to handle this. But regardless, there are several ways to accomplish this.

We can use...

+ a proxy server
+ an HTTP library
+ JavaScript

Lets look at an example of each.
