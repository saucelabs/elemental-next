# How to Work with Hovers

## Intro

If you need to work with mouse hovers in your tests, it might not be obvious how to do this with Selenium. A quick
search through the official Selenium documentation can also be confusing, and might leave you scouring online forums
and search engines for the solution.

## A Solution

The most popular use case for a hover action is to display additional menu options(submenu.)

By leveraging Selenium's [Action Builder](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/T_OpenQA_Selenium_Interactions_Actions.htm) we can handle more complex user interactions like hovers. This is
done by telling Selenium which element we want to move the mouse to, and then performing what we need to after.
