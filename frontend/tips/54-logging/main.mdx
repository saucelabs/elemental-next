# How to Access Selenium Logs in Real-Time

## Intro

Logging is a deep rabbit hole to fall down in Selenium. [The documentation](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Logging)
isn't complete and the approach for each of the browser and language bindings is inconsistent and hard to find examples
for.

## A Solution

By accessing what we want through the [WebDriver Wire Protocol](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol), we can get at the logs we want in a browser
agnostic way that also gets us the information in real time.


import DisplayTips from "../../src/components/displayTips";

<DisplayTips contentPath={"54-logging"} languages={[
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby' },
]} />
