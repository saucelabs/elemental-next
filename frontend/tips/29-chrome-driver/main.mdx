# How to Run Your Tests Locally Against Chrome

## Intro

It's straightforward to get your tests running locally against Firefox. But when you want to run them against a
different browser like Chrome, you quickly run into configuration overhead that can seem overly complex and
lacking in code examples for getting started.

With the introduction of WebDriver (circa Selenium 2) a lot of benefits were realized (e.g. more effective &
faster browser execution, no more single host origin issues, etc). But with it came some architectural & configuration
differences that may not be widely known. Namely -- browser drivers.

## A Solution

[WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/) works with each of the major browsers through a browser driver which is (ideally) maintained by the
browser manufacturer. It is an executable file (consider it a thin layer or a shim) that acts as a bridge between
Selenium and the browser.

[ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) is Google Chrome's browser driver. In this specific use case is of using WebDriver with Chrome
in testing locally.

Let's step through an example using ChromeDriver ([download here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)).
