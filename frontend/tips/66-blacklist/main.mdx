# How to Remove Third-Party Resources

## Intro

There are plenty of external resources that get loaded onto a page that aren't directly relevant to the
functionality you're testing (e.g., Facebook widgets, Analytics, JavaScript snippets, etc.). And these external
resources have the potential to negatively impact your test runs due to slow load times.

So how do you protect your tests from these things that are outside of your control?

## A Solution

By leveraging a proxy server in our tests we can block the external resources we don't want to load by adding them
to a blacklist.

Let's continue with an example.


import DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';

<DisplayTips contentPath={"66-blacklist"} languages={[
    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},
]}/>
