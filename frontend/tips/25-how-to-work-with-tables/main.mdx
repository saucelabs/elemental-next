# How to Work with HTML Data Tables

## Intro

Odds are at some point you've come across the use of tables in a web application to display data or information to a
user, giving them the option to sort and manipulate it. Depending on your application it can be quite common and
something you will want to write an automated test for.

When the table has no helpful, semantic markup (e.g. easy to use `id` or `class` attributes) it quickly becomes more
difficult to work with and write tests against it. And if you're able to pull something together, it will likely not
work against older browsers.

## A Solution

You can easily traverse a table through the use of [CSS Pseudo-classes](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp).

But keep in mind that if you care about older browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer 8, et al), then this approach won't
work on them. In those cases your best bet is to find a workable solution for the short term and get a front-end
developer to update the table with helpful attributes.

> ### A quick primer on Tables and CSS Pseudo-classes
> Understanding the broad strokes of an HTML table's structure goes a long way in writing effective automation against it. So here's a quick primer.
> A table has:- a header (e.g. `<thead>`)- a body (e.g. `<tbody>`).- rows (e.g. `<tr>`) -- horizontal slats of data- columns -- vertical slats of data
> Columns are made up of cells, which are:- a header (e.g., `<th>`)- one or more standard cells (e.g., `<td>` -- which is short for **table data**)CSS Pseudo-classes work by walking through the structure of an object and targeting a specific part of it based ona relative number (e.g. the **third** `<td>` cell from a row in the table body). This works well with tables sincewe can grab all instances of a target (e.g. the third `<td>` cell from each `<tr>` in the table body) and use it in
> our test -- which would give us all of the data for the third column.

Let's step through some examples for a common set of table functionality like sorting columns in ascending and descending order.
