## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries

First, we pull in our requisite classes
 * for annotations (e.g., `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test`),
 * opening the browser with Selenide (e.g., `com.codeborne.selenide.Selenide.open`),
 * Selenide api for frames (e.g., `com.codeborne.selenide.Selenide.switchTo`)

### Example 1

Our first test is `exampleOne`. In it, we'll step through [an example of nested frames](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/nested_frames) from
[the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet).

With Selenide's `.switchTo()` method we can easily switch to the frame we want. When using it for frames
(e.g., `driver.switchTo().frame();`) it accepts either an ID or name attribute. But in order to get the text of the
middle frame (e.g., a frame nested within another frame), we need to switch to the parent frame (e.g., the top frame)
first _and then_ switch to the child frame (e.g., the middle frame).

Once we've done that we're able to find the element we need, grab its text, and assert that it's what we expect.

## Example 2

Here is a more likely example you'll run into -- working with a
<abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> Editor like [TinyMCE](https://www.tinymce.com/). You can see
the page we're testing [here](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tinymce).

Once the page loads we switch into the frame that contains TinyMCE and:

- check the original text
- input another text
- check the new text

Keep in mind that if we need to access a part of the page outside the frame we're currently in we'll need to switch
to it. Thankfully Selenide has a method that enables us to quickly jump back to the top level of the page
-- `switchTo().defaultContent()`.

### More methods for frames

Selenide has more methods for working with frames, check:
* `switchTo().innerFrame()`
* `switchTo().frame("id", Duration.ofSeconds(6)); // switch with custom timeout`

### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `pom.xml` file.

<details>
    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>pom.xml</code> file.</summary>
    <div>
        <TipCode codePath={"3-work-with-frames/code/selenide/pom.xml"} language={"xml"}/>
    </div>
</details>

Finally, we can run the test by executing `mvn test` from the command-line.
