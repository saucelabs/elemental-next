## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries, Setup and Teardown

We'll first need to pull in our requisite libraries (`selenium-webdriver` to drive the browser, and
`rspec/expecations` & `RSpec::Matchers` to perform our assertions) and wire up some simple `setup`, `teardown`,
and `run` methods.

### Example 1

Line 20 shows our first test. In it, we'll step through [an example of nested frames](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/nested_frames) from
[the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet).

With Selenium's [`.switch_to.frame`](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/TargetLocator.html#frame-instance_method) method we can simply switch to the frame we want. It accepts either an
ID or name attribute, but in order to get the text of the middle frame (e.g., a frame nested within another frame),
we need to switch to the parent frame (e.g., the top frame) and then switch to the child frame (e.g., the middle frame).

Once we've done that we're able to find the element we need, grab it's text, and assert that it's what we expect.

While this example helps illustrate the point of frame switching, it's not very practical.

### Example 2

Here is a more likely example you'll run into -- working with a
<abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> Editor like
[TinyMCE](http://www.tinymce.com/). You can see the page we're testing [here](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tinymce).

Once the page loads we switch into the frame that contains TinyMCE and...

+ grab the original text and store it
+ clear and input new text
+ grab the new text value
+ assert that the original and new texts are not the same

Keep in mind that if we need to access a part of the page outside of the frame we are currently in we'll need to
switch to it. Thankfully Selenium has a method that enables us to quickly jump back to the top level of the page --
`switch_to.default_content`.

### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `Gemfile` file.

<details>
    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>Gemfile</code> file.</summary>
    <div>
        <TipCode codePath={"3-work-with-frames/code/ruby/Gemfile"} language={"txt"}/>
    </div>
</details>

Finally, we can run the test by executing `ruby frames.rb` from the command-line.
