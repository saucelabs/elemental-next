# How to Work with Frames

## Intro

In this tip, you'll learn how to work with frames and write tests against them.

On occasion, we may encounter relics of the front-end world, such as frames. When writing tests against them, it's
easy to make a mistake if we're not paying attention.

## A Solution

Rather than getting frustrated when authoring your tests, you can work with the elements in a frame by telling
Selenium to switch to that frame first. Then the rest of your test should be more straightforward.

Let's explore further with some examples.

import DisplayTips from "../../src/components/displayTips";
const contentLanguages = [
    { label: 'Python', value: 'python' },
    { label: 'C#', value: 'csharp' },
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java' },
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript' },
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby' },
];

<DisplayTips contentPath={"1-how-to-upload-a-file"} languages={contentLanguages} />
