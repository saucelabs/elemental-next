# How to Work with Frames

## The Problem

In this tip, you'll learn how to work with frames and write tests against them.

On occasion, we may encounter relics of the front-end world, such as frames. When writing tests against them, it's
easy to make a mistake if we're not paying attention.

## A Solution

Rather than getting frustrated when authoring your tests, you can work with the elements in a frame by telling
Selenium to switch to that frame first. Then the rest of your test should be more straightforward.

Let's explore further with some examples.

## Examples

import DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';

<DisplayTips contentPath={"3-work-with-frames"} languages={[
    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},
    {label: 'C#', value: 'csharp'},
    {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},
    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript'},
    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},
]}/>

## Expected Behavior

### Example 1

+ Open the browser
+ Visit the page
+ Switch to the nested frame
+ Grab the text from the frame and assert that Selenium is in the correct place
+ Close the browser

### Example 2

+ Open the browser
+ Visit the page
+ Switch to the frame that contains the TinyMCE editor
+ Grab and clear the text in the editor
+ Input and grab new text in the editor
+ Assert that the original and new text entries don't match
+ Switch to the top level of the page
+ Grab the text from the top of the page and assert that it's not empty
+ Close the browser

## Outro

Now you're ready to handily defeat frames when they cross your path.

Happy Testing!
