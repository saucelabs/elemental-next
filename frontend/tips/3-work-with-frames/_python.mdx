## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries, Setup and Teardown

Lines 1 to 9 are pulling in our requisite libraries our testing framework (e.g., `import pytest`), driving the browser
with Selenium (e.g., `from selenium import webdriver`), and a locator strategy to find the elements
(e.g. `from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By`), and wire up some setup and teardown methods for our tests.

### Example 1

Line 11 shows our first test. In it, we'll step through [an example of nested frames](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/nested_frames)
which can be found on [the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet).

With Selenium's `.switch_to.frame` method we can easily switch to the frame we want. It accepts either an ID or name
attribute. But in order to get the text of the middle frame (e.g., a frame nested within another frame), we need to
switch to the parent frame (e.g., the top frame) _and then_ switch to the child frame (e.g., the middle frame).

Once we've done that we're able to find the element we need, grab its text, and assert that it's what we expect.

While this example helps illustrate the point of frame switching, it's not very practical.

## Example 2

Line 18 shows a more likely example you'll run into -- working with a
<abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> Editor like [TinyMCE](http://www.tinymce.com/). You can see
the page we're testing on [the-internet](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tinymce).

### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to install the required libraries. We can do this by running
`pip install -r requirements.txt` from the command-line. The `requirements.txt` file contains the libraries we
need to install.

    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>requirements.txt</code> file.</summary>
    <div>
        <TipCode codePath={"3-work-with-frames/code/python/requirements.txt"} language={"txt"}/>
    </div>
</details>

After installing the required libraries, we can run the test by executing `pytest frames.py` from the command-line.
