## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries, Setup and Teardown

The first two lines are pulling in our testing framework (e.g., `require("assert")`), and driving the
browser with Selenium (e.g., `const {Builder, By} = require("selenium-webdriver");`).

After creating a `describe` to group our tests (e.g., `describe("Frame Test")...`), lines 5 to 13 are setting up and
tearing down the browser instance.

The `beforeEach` method, will execute before each test. In it, we are launching a new instance of Firefox with
Selenium and storing it in a class variable that we'll use throughout all tests. After our test executes the second
method, `afterEach`, will execute. This calls `driver.quit()` which ends the session by closing the browser instance.

### Example 1

Line 15 shows our first test. In it, In it we'll step through [an example of nested frames](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/nested_frames) from
[the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet).

With Selenium's `.switchTo().frame` method we can easily switch to the frame we want. It accepts either a numbered
index or WebElement (e.g., the result of a `findElement`).

In order to get the text of the middle frame (e.g., a frame nested within another frame), we first need to switch to
the parent frame (e.g., the top frame) _and then_ switch to the child frame (e.g., the middle frame). Once we've done
that we're able to find the element we need, grab its text, and assert that it's what we expect.

While this example helps illustrate the point of frame switching, it's not very practical.

### Example 2

Here is a more likely example you'll run into -- working with a
<abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> Editor like
[TinyMCE](http://www.tinymce.com/). You can see the page we're testing [here](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tinymce).

Keep in mind that if we need to access a part of the page outside of the frame we are currently in we'll need to
switch to it. Thankfully Selenium has method that enables us to quickly jump back to the top level of the page
-- `switchTo.defaultContent()`.

### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `package.json` file.

    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>package.json</code> file.</summary>
    <div>
        <TipCode codePath={"3-work-with-frames/code/javascript/package.json"} language={"json"}/>
    </div>
</details>

Finally, we can run the test by executing `npm test` from the command-line.
