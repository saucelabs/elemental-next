# How to Do Load Testing With Jmeter and Selenium

## Intro

In [a previous tip](http://elementalselenium.com/tips/48-load-testing) I demonstrated a way to accomplish a simple load test with a Selenium script and an HTTP
library. While it works, it's only useful for rudimentary test cases.

For more involved test cases and more powerful load generation, we're going to need something stronger.

## A Solution

JMeter is the defacto open source load testing solution that is used in industry. The hardest part of using it is
authoring the test cases (e.g., in the JMeter GUI). Thankfully we can sidestep that by repurposing our Selenium
tests into initial JMeter scripts. To do this we'll need a proxy server, the HTTP Archive (HAR) each test generates,
and a HAR to JMeter XML (JMX) converter.

When we're done, we'll have working JMeter test cases that we can modify and run (either from the GUI or the
command-line).

Let's dig in with an example.
