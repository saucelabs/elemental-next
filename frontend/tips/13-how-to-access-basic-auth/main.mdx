# How to Access Basic Auth

## Intro

In this guide, you will learn how to pass credentials to a site when requesting a page that is secured behind Basic HTTP Authentication.

Sometimes you'll work with applications that are secured behind [Basic HTTP Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) (a.k.a. Basic Auth). In order to access them you'll need to pass credentials to the site when requesting a page otherwise you'll get a system level pop-up prompting you for a username and password -- rendering Selenium helpless.

Before Selenium 2 we were able to accomplish this by injecting credentials into a custom header, but now a popular way to do it is using something like [BrowserMob Proxy](http://bmp.lightbody.net/). Some people are also solving this issue with browser specific configurations but those methods feel a little heavy and complicated.

Instead, let's use a more straightforward approach that is browser agnostic and quick to setup.
