# How to Opt-out of A/B Tests

## Intro

Occasionally when running tests you may see unexpected behavior due to [A/B testing (a.k.a. split testing)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) of
the application you're working with. In order to keep your tests running without issue we need a clean way to opt-out
of these split tests.

## A Solution

First, here is a primer on Split Testing.

> ### Split Testing

> Split testing is a simple way to experiment with an application's features to see which changes lead to higher user
> engagement. A simple example would be testing variations of an e-mail landing page to see if more people sign up.
> In such a split test there would be the control (how the application looks and behaves now) and variants (e.g., 2
> or 3 changes that could include changing text or images on the page, element positioning, color of the submit
> button, etc.). Once the variants are configured, they are put into rotation, and the experiment starts. During this
> experiment each user will see a different version of the feature and their engagement with it will be tracked. Split
> tests live for the length of the experiment or until a winner is found (e.g., tracking indicates that a variant
> converted higher than the control). If no winner is found, new variants may be created and another experiment tried.
> If a winner is found, then the winning variant becomes the new control and the feature gets updated accordingly.

Thankfully there are some standard opt-out mechanisms built into A/B testing platforms. They tend to come in the
form of an appended URL or forging a cookie.

Let's start with an example for each approach with a popular A/B testing platform, [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/).
