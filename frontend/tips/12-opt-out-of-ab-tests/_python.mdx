## Example

Our example page is from [the-internet](http://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet) and can be seen [here](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/abtest). There are three different versions of the page that are available. On each page the heading text will vary:

+ Control: `A/B Test Control`
+ Variation 1: `A/B Test Variation 1`
+ Opt-out: `No A/B Test`

Let's start things off by loading our requisite libraries (`import unittest` for our test framework and `from selenium import webdriver` to drive the browser), declare our test class, and wire up some test `setUp` and `tearDown` methods.

```python
# filename: ab_test_opt_out.py
import unittest
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By


class ABTestOptOut(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Firefox()

    def tearDown(self):
        self.driver.quit()
# ...
```

Now let's begin our first test to step through loading the split testing page and verifying that the text changes after we forge an opt-out cookie.

```python
# filename: ab_test_opt_out.py
# ...
    def test_forge_cookie_on_target_page(self):
        driver = self.driver
        driver.get('http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/abtest')
        heading_text = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME,'h3').text
        assert heading_text in ['A/B Test Variation 1', 'A/B Test Control']
        driver.add_cookie({'name' : 'optimizelyOptOut', 'value' : 'true'})
        driver.refresh()
        heading_text = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME,'h3').text
        assert heading_text == 'No A/B Test'

# ...
```

After navigating to the page we confirm that we are in one of the A/B test groups by grabbing the heading text and checking to see if it matches what we expect. After that we add the opt-out cookie, refresh the page, and then confirm that we are no longer in the A/B test group by checking the heading text again.

We could also load the opt-out cookie before navigating to this page.

```python
# filename: ab_test_opt_out.py
# ...
    def test_forge_cookie_on_homepage_then_navigate_to_target_page(self):
        driver = self.driver
        driver.get('http://the-internet.herokuapp.com')
        driver.add_cookie({'name' : 'optimizelyOptOut', 'value' : 'true'})
        driver.get('http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/abtest')
        heading_text = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME,'h3').text
        assert heading_text == 'No A/B Test'

# ...
```

Here we are navigating to the main page of the site first and then adding the opt-out cookie. After that we navigate to the split test page and then perform our check. Alternatively, we could opt out without forging a cookie. Instead, we just need to append an opt out parameter to the URL.

```python
# filename: ab_test_opt_out.py
    def test_url_parameter(self):
            driver = self.driver
            driver.get('http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/abtest?optimizely_opt_out=true')
            driver.switch_to.alert.dismiss()
            heading_text = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME,'h3').text
            assert heading_text == 'No A/B Test'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

By appending `?optimizely_opt_out=true` we achieve the same outcome as before. Keep in mind that this approach triggers a JavaScript alert, so we have to switch to and dismiss it (e.g., `driver.switch_to.alert.dismiss()`) before performing our check.

## Expected Behavior

When we save this file and run it (e.g., `python ab_test_opt_out.py` from the command-line) here is what will happen with either of the tests:

+ Open the browser
+ Opt-out of the split tests (either by cookie or appended URL)
+ Visit the split testing page
+ Grab the header text
+ Confirm that the session is opted out of the split test
+ Close the browser

## Summary

Hopefully this tip was helpful in guiding you in different methods of how to opt out of split tests.

Happy Testing!
