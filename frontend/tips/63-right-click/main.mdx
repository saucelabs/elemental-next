# How to Right-click

## Intro

Sometimes you'll run into an app that has functionality hidden behind a right-click menu (a.k.a. a context menu).
These menus tend to be system level menus that are untouchable by Selenium. So how do you test this functionality?

## A Solution

By leveraging [Selenium's Action Builder](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/T_OpenQA_Selenium_Interactions_Actions.htm) we can issue a right-click command (a.k.a. a [`ContextClick`](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/M_OpenQA_Selenium_Interactions_Actions_ContextClick.htm)).

We can then select an option from the menu by traversing it with keyboard arrow keys (which we can issue with the
Action Builder's [`SendKeys`](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/M_OpenQA_Selenium_Interactions_Actions_SendKeys_1.htm) command).

Let's continue with an example.



import DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';

<DisplayTips languages={[
    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},
    {label: 'C#', value: 'csharp'},
    {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},
    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript'},
    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},
]}/>
