# How to Test Forgot Password

## Intro

Testing e-mail can be a tricky process. Especially when dealing with things like forgot password. A lot of times this
is something that gets checked manually. Or worse, it gets overlooked and ends up broken in production.

## A Solution

By leveraging a third-party library we can perform an end-to-end test by accessing a forgot password email from a
Gmail account headless (to get the information we need) and then put it to use with Selenium to make sure it works
correctly.

Let's dig in with an example that uses [the forgot password example](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/forgot_password)
on [the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet).


import DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';

<DisplayTips contentPath={"43-forgot-password"} languages={[
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby' },
]} />
