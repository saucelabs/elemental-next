# Implicit vs Explicit Waits

## Intro

In order to make our Selenium tests resilient, we need to make them wait for certain elements to load. Elements that we want to interact with. This is especially true with JavaScript heavy pages.

But should we be using static sleeps, implicit waits, explicit waits?

Static sleeps are something to be avoided, because they force your tests to wait a _hard-coded_ amount of time to perform an action -- this is not recommended. But what about implicit waits, explicit waits... and what about using them together?

## A Solution

The short answer? Use explicit waits.

Adding an implicit wait to your Selenium tests is simple enough and may seem intuitive. But there are cases where it
simply doesn't help you like you think it will. And while you can combine explicit and implicit waits together
(e.g., override an implicit wait with an explicit wait to make a Selenium action wait longer) -- you shouldn't.
I'll discuss more on that later.

Let's continue with some examples.
