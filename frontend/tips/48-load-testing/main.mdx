# How to Do Load Testing

## Intro

How do you do load testing in Selenium? While there are plenty of resources citing that while it _can_ be done,
there are better tools for the job. Tools like [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) are often recommended, but they can be intimidating
and challenging to get started with.

There are other approaches to this, and it can be a bumpy road to do load testing, and you might go down a
rabbit-hole struggling with Selenium infrastructure and third-party tools.

## A Solution

Rather than invest time, money, and frustration into JMeter, a Selenium infrastructure, or a third-party provider,
we can generate a good amount of load by leveraging an existing Selenium script, a proxy server, and an HTTP client
library along with some parallel threads.

With a proxy server we can capture the HTTP requests generated by Selenium and replay them with an HTTP client
library in parallel -- effectively replicating the same actions hitting the web server simultaneously, in large
numbers.

Let's continue with an example.
