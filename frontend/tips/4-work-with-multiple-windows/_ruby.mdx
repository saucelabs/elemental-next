## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries, Setup and Teardown

We'll first need to pull in our requisite libraries (`selenium-webdriver` to drive the browser, and
`rspec/expecations` & `RSpec::Matchers` to perform our assertions) and wire up some simple `setup`, `teardown`,
and `run` methods.

### Example 1

Line 19 shows a test that exercises new window functionality from an application. In this case, we'll be using
[the new window example](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/windows) from [the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet).

After loading the page we click the link which spawns a new window. We then grab the window handles (a.k.a. unique
identifier strings which represent each open browser window) and switch between them based on their order (assuming
that the first one is the originating window, and that the second one is the new window). We round this test out by
performing a simple check against the title of the page to make sure Selenium is focused on the correct window.

While this may seem like a good approach it can present problems later because the order of the window handles is not
consistent across all browsers. Some return it in the order opened, others _alphabetically_.

Here's a more resilient approach. One that will work across all browsers.

### Example 2

Line 31 shows that after loading the page we store the window handles in a variable (e.g., `first_window`)
and then proceed with clicking the new window link.

Now that we have two windows open we grab all the window handles and search through them to find the new window
handle (e.g., the handle that doesn't match the first one we've already stored). We store the result in another
variable (e.g., `second_window`) and then switch between the windows. Each time checking the page title to make sure
the correct window is in focus.

For more information about switching windows (and tabs) visit the official Selenium
[documentation page](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/interactions/windows/).

### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `Gemfile` file.

Finally, we can run the test by executing `ruby windows.rb` from the command-line.
