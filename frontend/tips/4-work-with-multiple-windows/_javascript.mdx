## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries, Setup and Teardown

The first two lines are pulling in our testing framework (e.g., `require("assert")`), driving the
browser with Selenium (e.g., `const {Builder, By} = require("selenium-webdriver");`). Then we wire up
some test setup and teardown methods.

### Example 1

Line 15 shows a test that exercises new window functionality from an application. In this case, we'll be using
[the new window example](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/windows) from [the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet).

After loading the page we click the link which spawns a new window. We then grab the window handles (a.k.a. unique
identifier strings which represent each open browser window) and switch between them based on their order (assuming
that the first one is the originating window, and that the second one is the new window). We round this test out by
performing a simple check against the title of the page to make sure Selenium is focused on the correct window.

While this may seem like a good approach it can present problems later because the order of the window handles is not
consistent across all browsers. Some return it in the order opened, others _alphabetically_.

Here's a more resilient approach. One that will work across all browsers.

### Example 2

Line 29 shows that after loading the page we store the window handles in a variable (e.g., `windowHandlesBefore`)
and then proceed with clicking the new window link.

Now that we have two windows open we grab all the window handles again (e.g., `windowHandlesAfter`) and search
through them to find the new window handle (e.g., the handle that's in the new window handle collection but not the
initial one). We store the result in another variable (e.g., `newWindow`) and then switch between the windows each
time checking the page title to make sure the correct window is in focus.

For more information about switching windows (and tabs) visit the official Selenium
[documentation page](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/interactions/windows/).


### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `package.json` file.

<details>
    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>package.json</code> file.</summary>
    <div>
        <TipCode codePath={"4-work-with-multiple-windows/code/javascript/package.json"} language={"json"}/>
    </div>
</details>

Finally, we can run the test by executing `npm test` from the command-line.
