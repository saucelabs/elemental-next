## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries, Setup and Teardown

First let's import our requisite classes
 * for annotations (e.g., `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test`),
 * opening the browser with Selenide (e.g., `com.codeborne.selenide.Selenide.open`),
 * matchers for assertions (e.g., `com.codeborne.selenide.Condition.text`)
 * etc.

Next, we'll start our class off with some setup, covered in line 18.

### The test

Line 22 shows a test that exercises new window functionality from an application. In this case, we'll be using
[the new window example](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/windows) from [the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet).

After loading the page we click the link with text "Click Here" which spawns a new window.

We then switch between windows based on their order (assuming that the first one is the originating window, and 
the second one is the new window). We round this test out by performing a simple check against the title of 
the page to make sure Selenide is focused on the correct window.

### Details

* In line 23, we check a pre-condition: the browser has only one window before we start any actions
* In line 24, we click the link "Click Here"
* In line 26, we check that now the browser has 2 windows
* In lines 27-28, we check that the active window is still the first one (we check its title and url)
* In line 30, we switch to the "new" window (index 0 for the original window, index 1 for the new window)
* In lines 32-33, we check that the active window is the new one (we check its title and url)

### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `pom.xml` file.

<details>
    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>pom.xml</code> file.</summary>
    <div>
        <TipCode codePath={"4-work-with-multiple-windows/code/selenide/pom.xml"} language={"xml"}/>
    </div>
</details>

Finally, we can run the test by executing `mvn test` from the command-line.
