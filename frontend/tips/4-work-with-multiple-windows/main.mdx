# How to Work with Multiple Windows

## Intro

This tip will explain how to work with multiple windows in Selenium and switch between them.

Occasionally you'll run into a link or action in the application you're testing that will open a new window. In order
to work with both the new and originating windows you'll need to switch between them.

On the face of it, this is a pretty straightforward concept. But there may be a small challenge to watch out for
that you may find in some browsers and not others.

Let's step through a couple of examples to demonstrate.


import DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';

<DisplayTips contentPath={"4-work-with-multiple-windows"} languages={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'python' },
    { label: 'C#', value: 'csharp' },
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java' },
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript' },
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby' },
]} />
