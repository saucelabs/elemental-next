# How to Work with Multiple Windows

## The Problem

This tip will explain how to work with multiple windows in Selenium and switch between them.

Occasionally you'll run into a link or action in the application you're testing that will open a new window. In order
to work with both the new and originating windows you'll need to switch between them.

On the face of it, this is a pretty straightforward concept. But there may be a small challenge to watch out for
that you may find in some browsers and not others.

Let's step through a couple of examples to demonstrate.


import DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';

<DisplayTips languages={[
    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},
    {label: 'C#', value: 'csharp'},
    {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},
    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript'},
    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},
    {label: 'Selenide', value: 'selenide'},
]}/>

## Expected Behavior

- Open the browser
- Visit the page
- Click to open a new window
- Switch between the windows
- Check the page title to make sure the correct window is in focus
- Close the browser

## Outro

We hope this was a helpful guide on how to work with and switch between multiple windows.

Happy Testing!
