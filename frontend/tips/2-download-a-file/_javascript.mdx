## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries

Lines 1 to 5 are pulling in our requisite classes for interacting with the operating system (e.g., `require("path");`),
our testing framework (e.g., `mocha` and `require("assert")`), and driving the browser with
Selenium (e.g., `const {Builder, By} = require("selenium-webdriver");`).

### Setup and Teardown

After creating a `describe` to group our tests (e.g., `describe("Download Test")...`), lines 11 to 38 contain the setup
and teardown, and then we are declaring two variables. One for the Selenium instance (e.g., `driver`) and the other
for the temporary directory where we'll want to automatically download files to (e.g., `tmpDir`). In it we're storing
the absolute path to the current working directory, plus the name `tmp`.

In the setup method (e.g., `beforeEach`) we create this directory if it's not already there, and then create a
new browser options object (for Firefox in this case), specifying the necessary configuration parameters to make
it automatically download the file where we want (e.g., in the newly created temp directory).

Here's a breakdown of each of the browser preferences being set:

+ `browser.download.dir` accepts a string. This is how we set the custom download path. It needs to be an absolute path.
+ `browser.download.folderList` takes a number. It tells Firefox which download directory to use. `2` tells it to use
a custom download path, whereas `1` would use the browser's default path, and `0` would place them on the Desktop.
+ `browser.helperApps.neverAsk.saveToDisk` tells Firefox when not to prompt for a file download. It accepts a string
of [the file's MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type). If you want to specify more than one, you do it with a comma-separated string (which
we've done).
+ `pdfjs.disabled` is for when downloading PDFs. This overrides the sensible default in Firefox that previews PDFs in
the browser. It accepts a boolean.

We then hand the options object on to Selenium as part of the incantation to create a new browser instance.

In the teardown (e.g., `beforeEach`) we close the browser instance and then clean up the temp directory by deleting
its contents, and then the directory itself.

### The Test

Lines 48 to 53 are the test itself.

After visiting the page we find the first download link and click it. The click triggers an automatic download to
the temp directory. After the file downloads, we wait using Selenium's `wait` method to make sure the file is
completely downloaded before we check its size. Then, we perform some rudimentary checks to make sure the temp
directory contains files and the first file in the directory is not empty.

### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `package.json` file.

<details>
    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>package.json</code> file.</summary>
    <div>
        <TipCode codePath={"2-download-a-file/code/javascript/package.json"} language={"json"}/>
    </div>
</details>

Finally, we can run the test by executing `npm test` from the command-line.
