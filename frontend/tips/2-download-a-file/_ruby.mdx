## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries

Lines 1 to 4 are pulling in our requisite libraries (e.g., `selenium-webdriver` to drive the browser,
`rspec/expectations` and `RSpec::Matchers` for assertions, `uuid` to help create a uniquely named temporary
download directory, and `fileutils` to create & destroy the temp directory) and wiring up our `setup` method.


### Setup and Teardown

Lines 8 to 24 are setting up and tearing down the test. Our `setup` method is where the magic is happening in this
example. In it, we're creating a uniquely named temp directory and storing the absolute path of it in an instance
variable that we'll use throughout this file.

We're also setting a few browser preferences (for Firefox in this case) and plying it with the necessary configuration
parameters to make it automatically download the file where we want. Here's a breakdown of each of them:

+ `browser.download.dir` accepts a string. This is how we set the custom download path. It needs to be an absolute path.
+ `browser.download.folderList` takes a number. It tells Firefox which download directory to use. `2` tells it to use
a custom download path, wheras `1` would use the browser's default path, and `0` would place them on the Desktop.
+ `browser.helperApps.neverAsk.saveToDisk` tells Firefox when not to prompt for a file download. It accepts a string
of [the file's MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type). If you want to specify more than one, you do it with a comma-separated string.
+ `pdfjs.disabled` is for when downloading PDFs. This overrides the sensible default in Firefox that previews PDFs in
the browser. It accepts a boolean.

These preferences are then passed into our instance of Selenium.

In `teardown` we make sure to clean up the temp directory after closing the browser. Other than that, it's business
as usual.

The `run` method is a custom method that we've defined to execute our test. It's a simple wrapper around the `setup`
and `teardown` methods. We're using it to keep our test code clean and easy to read.

### The Test

Lines 33 to 42 are the test itself.

After loading the page we find the first download link and click it. The click triggers an automatic download to
the temp directory created in `setup`. After that, we perform some rudimentary checks to make sure the directory
isn't empty and that the file isn't empty either.

### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `Gemfile` file.

        <TipCode codePath={"2-download-a-file/code/ruby/Gemfile"} language={"txt"}/>

Finally, we can run the test by executing `ruby download.rb` from the command-line.
