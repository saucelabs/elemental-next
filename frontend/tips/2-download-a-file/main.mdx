# How To Download a File

## Intro

Just like with [uploading files](/tips/how-to-upload-a-file/1-upload-a-file) we hit the same issue with downloading
them -- a dialog box just out of Selenium's reach. With some additional configuration, we can side-step the dialog box.

## A Solution

In order to avoid the dialog box, we will be instructing the browser to download files to a specific location without
being prompted.

After the file is downloaded we can then perform some simple checks to make sure the file is what we expect.

Let's continue with an example.


import DisplayTips from "../../src/components/displayTips";

<DisplayTips contentPath={"2-download-a-file"} languages={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'python' },
    { label: 'C#', value: 'csharp' },
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java' },
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript' },
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby' },
]} />
