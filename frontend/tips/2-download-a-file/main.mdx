# How To Download a File

## The Problem

Just like with [uploading files](/tips/1-upload-a-file) we hit the same issue with downloading
them -- a dialog box just out of reach of your automation script. With some additional configuration, we can side-step
the dialog box.

## A Solution

In order to avoid the dialog box, we will be instructing the browser to download files to a specific location without
being prompted. After the file is downloaded we can then perform some simple checks to make sure the file is what we
expect.

Let's continue with an example.

## Example


import DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';

<DisplayTips languages={[
    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},
    {label: 'C#', value: 'csharp'},
    {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},
    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript'},
    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},
    {label: 'Selenide', value: 'selenide'},
]}/>

## Expected Behavior

After executing the test, this is what will happen:

+ Create a uniquely named temp directory in the present working directory
+ Open the browser
+ Visit the page
+ Find and click the first download link on the page
+ Automatically download the file to the temp directory without prompting
+ Check that the temp directory is not empty
+ Check that the downloaded file is not empty
+ Close the browser
+ Delete the temp directory

## Outro

A similar approach can be applied to some other browsers with varying configurations. But downloading files this
way is not sustainable or recommended. Mark Collin articulates this point well in his prominent
[write-up about it](https://ardesco.lazerycode.com/index.php/2012/07/how-to-download-files-with-selenium-and-why-you-shouldnt/).
In a future tip we will cover a more reliable, faster, and scalable browser-agnostic approach to downloading files.
Stay tuned.

Happy Testing!
