## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries

Lines 3 to 14 are pulling in our requisite classes for annotations (e.g., `org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach`, etc.),
driving the browser with Selenium (e.g., `org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver`, etc.), matchers for assertions
(e.g., `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;`, etc. ), something to handle local files (e.g., `java.io.File`), and a means
to create a uniquely named folder to place downloaded files in (e.g., `java.util.UUID`)

### Setup and Teardown

Lines 21 to 42 are setting up and tearing down the browser instance. The `beforeEach` method, will execute before
each test. In it we're creating a uniquely named temp directory (e.g., `UUID.randomUUID().toString();`), configuring a
browser options object (for Firefox in this case), and plying it with the necessary configuration parameters to make
it automatically download the file where we want (e.g., in the newly created temp directory).

Here's a breakdown of each of the browser preferences being set:

+ `browser.download.dir` accepts a string. This is how we set the custom download path. It needs to be an absolute path.
+ `browser.download.folderList` takes a number. It tells Firefox which download directory to use. `2` tells it to use
a custom download path, wheras `1` would use the browser's default path, and `0` would place them on the Desktop.
+ `browser.helperApps.neverAsk.saveToDisk` tells Firefox when not to prompt for a file download. It accepts a string
of [the file's MIME type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type). If you want to specify more than one, you do it with a comma-separated string.
+ `pdfjs.disabled` is for when downloading PDFs. This overrides the sensible default in Firefox that previews PDFs
in the browser. It accepts a boolean.

This options object is then passed into our instance of Selenium (e.g., `driver = new FirefoxDriver(options);`).

After our test executes the second method, `afterEach`, will execute. In it, we close the browser instance and then
clean up the temp directory by deleting the files in the temp folder and then the temp folder.

### The Test

Lines 45 to 60 are the test itself.

After visiting the page we find the first download link and click it. The click triggers an automatic download to the
temp directory created in `setUp()`. We need to wait for the download to finish, so we use Selenium's `WebDriverWait` to
wait up to 5 seconds. After the file downloads, we perform some rudimentary checks to make sure the temp directory
isn't empty and then check the file (or files) that they aren't empty either.

### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `pom.xml` file.

<details>
    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>pom.xml</code> file.</summary>
    <div>
        <TipCode codePath={"2-download-a-file/code/java/pom.xml"} language={"xml"}/>
    </div>
</details>

Finally, we can run the test by executing `mvn test` from the command-line.
