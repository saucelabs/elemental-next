## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries

Lines 1 to 6 are pulling in our requisite classes for interacting with the operating system (e.g., `using System.IO;`),
our testing framework (e.g., `using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;`), driving the browser with
Selenium (e.g., `using OpenQA.Selenium;`), launching an instance of Firefox
(e.g., `using OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox;`), and Selenium's wait functions (e.g., `using OpenQA.Selenium.Support.UI;`).

### Setup and Teardown

After specifying the namespace and the class (e.g., `public class FileDownloadTest`), lines 17 to 35 are setting up and
tearing down the browser instance.

First we create a field variable (e.g., `IWebDriver _driver;`) to store our WebDriver instance for reuse throughout
the class.

We then create a `SetUp()` method with a `[TestInitialize]` attribute, so it runs before our test. This is where the
magic is happening in this example. In it, we're creating a uniquely named temp directory
(e.g., `System.Guid.NewGuid().ToString();`), configuring a browser options object (for Firefox in this case), and
plying it with the necessary configuration parameters to make it automatically download the file where we want
(e.g., in the newly created temp directory).

Here's a breakdown of each of the browser preferences being set:

- `browser.download.dir` accepts a string. This is how we set the custom download path. It needs to be an absolute path.
- `browser.download.folderList` takes a number. It tells Firefox which download directory to use. `2` tells it to use
a custom download path, whereas `1` would use the browser's default path, and `0` would place them on the Desktop.
- `browser.helperApps.neverAsk.saveToDisk` tells Firefox when not to prompt for a file download. It accepts a string
of [the file's MIME type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type). If you want to specify more than one, you do it with a comma-separated string (which
we've done).
- `pdfjs.disabled` is for when downloading PDFs. This overrides the sensible default in Firefox that previews PDFs in
the browser. It accepts a boolean.

The options are then passed into our instance of Selenium (e.g., `_driver = new FirefoxDriver(Options);`).

After our test executes, the `TearDown()` method will run thanks to the `[TestCleanup]` attribute. This
calls `_driver?.Quit();` which will close the browser instance. Then, it will clean up the temp directory by deleting
it. Specifying `true` as a second parameter for `Directory.Delete()` will recursively delete the files in the folder
before deleting it.

### The Test

Lines 38 to 56 are the test itself.

We create an `DownloadFileToDisk()` method and add a `[TestMethod]` attribute, so it is run as a test. In it, we visit
the page we find the first download link and click it. The click triggers an automatic download to the temp directory
created in `SetUp()`. We need to wait for the download to finish, so we leverage the `WebDriverWait` class to wait for
the file to exist in the directory. After the file downloads, we perform some rudimentary checks to make sure the
unique temp directory isn't empty and then check the file (or files) to see that they aren't empty either.

### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the project file (e.g.,
`csharp.csproj` in this case).

<details>
    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>csharp.csproj</code> file.</summary>
    <div>
        <TipCode codePath={"2-download-a-file/code/csharp/csharp.csproj"} language={"xml"}/>
    </div>
</details>

Finally, we can run the test by executing `dotnet test` from the command-line.
