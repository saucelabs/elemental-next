# How to Download Secure Files

## Intro

Previously, we've gone over how to test file downloads without a browser by leveraging Selenium Webdriver and an
HTTP library in tandem.

This approach is great for testing general file downloads, but what if the file you want to download is behind
authentication?

## A Solution

To access secure files with our HTTP library we'll need to pull the authenticated session information out of
Selenium's cookie store and pass it into the HTTP library when we perform the request.

Let's continue with some examples.
