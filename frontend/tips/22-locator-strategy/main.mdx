# Choosing a Locator Strategy

## Intro

In web design CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to apply styles to the markup (HTML) on a page. CSS is able to do
this by declaring which bits of the the markup it wants to interact with through the use of selectors. Selenium
operates in a similar manner but instead of changing the style of elements it interacts with them by clicking,
getting values from, typing, sending keys, etc.

At the heart of Selenium is the ability to interact with a page through its elements by way of various locator
strategies. Identifier, Id, Name, Link, DOM, XPath, and CSS -- oh my!

This is the life-blood of your automated tests and there are numerous elements to choose from. But which ones do
you use? And when do you use them and why?

## A Solution

While each locator strategy serves its purpose there is one approach that is better. It is one that is
cross-browser performant, simpler to maintain, and powerful -- that's CSS Selectors.
