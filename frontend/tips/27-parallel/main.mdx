# How to Speed Up Your Tests With Parallelization

## Intro

Compared to Unit and Integration Tests, Selenium is slow. A single test can easily take minutes to run. And when you
have a lot of them, it can quickly compound your suite to take hours to complete (just for a single browser) --
hampering your ability to get fast feedback.

## A Solution

Rather than run your tests in series (which is what you get out of the box with Selenium) you can dramatically speed
things up by running them in parallel. Couple this with
[the ability to run your tests in any browser](https://elementalselenium.com/docs/cloud/26-cloud), and you're on to
some solid footing with your test automation.

But keep in mind that doing this requires some consideration into how you structure your tests, but the pay off is
well worth the effort.
