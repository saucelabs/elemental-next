## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries

First, we are pulling in our requisite classes for interacting with the operating system (e.g., `using System.IO;`),
our testing framework (e.g., `using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;`), driving the browser with
Selenium (e.g., `using OpenQA.Selenium;`), and launching an instance of Firefox
(e.g., `using OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox;`).

### Setup and Teardown

After specifying the namespace and the class (e.g., `public class NewWindowNewTabTest`), we are setting up and
tearing down the browser instance.

First we create a field variable (e.g., `IWebDriver _driver;`) to store our WebDriver instance for reuse throughout
the class. We then create a `SetUp()` method with a `[TestInitialize]` attribute, so it runs before our test. In this
method we are creating an instance of WebDriver with Firefox (e.g., `_driver = new FirefoxDriver();`).

After our test executes, the `TearDown()` method will run thanks to the `[TestCleanup]` attribute. This
calls `_driver?.Quit();` which will close the browser instance.

### Open New Window

`NewWindowTest` shows how to open a new window, switch to it, and assert the number of window handles open. They key
to this is the `_driver.SwitchTo().NewWindow(WindowType.Window)` line. Which opens a new window and switches to it.

### Open New Tab

`NewTabTest` shows how to open a new tab, switch to it, and assert the number of window handles open. They key to this
is the `_driver.SwitchTo().NewWindow(WindowType.Tab)` line. Which opens a new tab and switches to it.

### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the project file (e.g.,
`csharp.csproj` in this case).

<details>
    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>csharp.csproj</code> file.</summary>
    <div>
        <TipCode codePath={"6-open-new-window/code/csharp/csharp.csproj"} language={"xml"}/>
    </div>
</details>

Finally, we can run the test by executing `dotnet test` from the command-line.
