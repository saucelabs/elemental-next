## Code Walkthrough

### Importing Libraries

First let's import our requisite classes (for annotations (e.g., `org.junit.After`, etc.), driving the
browser with Selenium (e.g., `org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver`, etc.), and matchers for our assertions
(e.g., `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions`, etc.)), and start our class with some setup and teardown
methods.

### Setup and Teardown

After specifying the namespace and the class (e.g., `public class NewWindowNewTabTest`), we are setting up and
tearing down the browser instance. The `beforeEach` method, will execute before
each test. In it we are launching a new instance of Firefox with Selenium and storing it in a class variable that
we'll use throughout all tests. After our test executes the second method, `afterEach`, will execute. This calls
`driver.quit()` which ends the session by closing the browser instance.

### Open New Window

`newWindow` shows how to open a new window, switch to it, and assert the number of window handles open. They key
to this is the `driver.switchTo().newWindow(WindowType.WINDOW)` line. Which opens a new window and switches to it.

### Open New Tab

`newTab` shows how to open a new tab, switch to it, and assert the number of window handles open. They key to this
is the `driver.switchTo().newWindow(WindowType.TAB)` line. Which opens a new tab and switches to it.

### Executing the Test

Before executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `pom.xml` file.

        <TipCode codePath={"6-open-new-window/code/java/pom.xml"} language={"xml"}/>
    </div>
</details>

Finally, we can run the test by executing `mvn test` from the command-line.
