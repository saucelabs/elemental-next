# How to Press Keyboard Keys

## Intro

On occasion, you'll come across functionality that requires the use of keyboard key presses in your tests.

Perhaps you'll need to tab to traverse from one portion of the page to another, back out of some kind of menu or
overlay with the escape key, or even submit a form with Enter.

But how do you do it and where do you start?

## A Solution

You can easily issue a key press by using the `SendKeys` command. This can be done to a specific element, or
generically with Selenium's Action Builder (which has been documented on
[the Selenium Actions page for Building Advanced User Interactions](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/T_OpenQA_Selenium_Interactions_Actions.htm)).

Either approach will send a key press. The latter approach will send it to the element that's currently in
focus in the browser (so you don't have to specify a locator along with it), whereas the prior approach will
send the key press directly to the element found.

You can see a full list of Selenium's available keyboard keys [here](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/T_OpenQA_Selenium_Keys.htm).

Let's try out a couple of examples.


import DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';

<DisplayTips languages={[
    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},
    {label: 'C#', value: 'csharp'},
    {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},
    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript'},
    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},
]}/>
