## How We Perform Accessibility Tests üß™

To ensure the accessibility of our digital assets, one of the primary tools we use is the Deque Axe Chrome extension. Axe is a powerful accessibility testing tool that helps us identify and address accessibility issues in our web applications.

By leveraging the Deque Axe Chrome extension, we can conduct comprehensive accessibility scans right within the Chrome browser. This allows us to catch accessibility issues early in the development process and implement necessary improvements to make our products more inclusive.

## How to Use the Reports üìò

Each accessibility report provides detailed information about the accessibility features implemented, any known issues, and the steps we are taking to address them. By reviewing these reports, you can gain a better understanding of the steps we are taking to improve accessibility and make our products usable by all. üöÄ
