# How to Work with JavaScript Alerts

## Intro

Built into Selenium is the ability to switch to an alert window and either accept or dismiss it. This way your tests can continue unencumbered by dialog boxes.

A popular use case for alerts is in the case of error prevention for password restrictions.

If your application triggers any JavaScript pop-ups (a.k.a. alerts, dialogs, etc.) then you need to know how to handle them in your Selenium tests.
