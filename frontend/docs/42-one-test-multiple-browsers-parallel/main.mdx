# How to Run a Test on Multiple Browsers, In Parallel

## Intro

In the previous tip I covered how to run a single test against multiple browsers. While this could come in handy,
it is still a bit lacking.

Right now, the test is only being run one at a time (a.k.a. in series) for each browser in our list. If this were
a longer running test and/or if there were more browsers we cared about, then this could quickly stack up to longer
test run times.
