## A Solution

Let's remedy this by taking [the previous tip's example](https://elementalselenium.com/docs/one-test-multiple-browsers/41-one-test-multiple-browsers) 
and parallelize it with the help of [threads](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_multithreading.htm).

## Example

Our initial setup stays mostly the same. There are only a couple of minor changes we'll need to make.

```ruby
ENV['SAUCE_USERNAME'] = 'your username'
ENV['SAUCE_API_KEY']  = 'your api key'

require 'selenium-webdriver'
require 'rspec/expectations'

def setup(browser_name, browser_version)
  caps = Selenium::WebDriver::Remote::Capabilities.send(browser_name.to_sym)
  caps.platform = 'Windows XP'
  caps.version = browser_version.to_s

  Thread.current[:driver] = Selenium::WebDriver.for(
    :remote,
    url: "https://#{ENV['SAUCE_USERNAME']}:#{ENV['SAUCE_API_KEY']}@ondemand.saucelabs.com/wd/hub",
    desired_capabilities: caps)
end

def teardown
  Thread.current[:driver].quit
end
```

Since we are working with threads, we will need to use variables that are thread safe. The best candidates are 
thread local variables. They have a global scope (similar to global variables) but are only accessible from within 
the thread that created it. This way we won't run into any odd collisions across simultaneous test runs.

So instead of instance variables (e.g., `@driver`) we are now storing each instance of Selenium in this new kind of 
variable and referencing it as needed (e.g., `Thread.current[:driver]`).

```ruby
# filename: example42.rb

BROWSERS = { firefox: '27',
             chrome: '32',
             internet_explorer: '8' }

def run
  threads = []
  BROWSERS.each_pair do |browser, browser_version|
    threads << Thread.new do
      setup(browser, browser_version)
      yield
      teardown
    end
  end
  threads.each { |thread| thread.join }
end
```

Our browser list remains untouched, but our `run` method has been updated to spawn and join threads (which is how 
you finish a thread). With this setup a new thread will be spawned for each of the browsers in the list, perform 
its actions, and finish.

Will all of that in place, we just need to update our test to use the new thread local driver variable.

```ruby
run do
  Thread.current[:driver].get 'https://the-internet.herokuapp.com'
  Thread.current[:driver].title.should == 'The Internet'
end
```

If we run this script from the command line (`ruby examle42.rb`) and head over 
[the Sauce Labs Account page](https://saucelabs.com/account), then we should see three tests running simultaneously.

NOTE: the number of parallel sessions allotted to your Sauce Labs account will dictate how quickly your tests will 
finish. For instance, if you add two new browsers to `BROWSER_LIST` and run this, only 3 sessions will run in Sauce 
Labs, queuing the other two until some of the original sessions finish.

## Expected Behavior

+ Simultaneously loads each browser in a Sauce Labs job
+ Each test loads the page and asserts the title is correct
+ Each session closes when it is complete

## Summary

There are alternative ways to run your tests in parallel. Some more notable approaches include:

+ through a test framework (e.g., TestNG in Java)
+ through Continuous Integration
+ through a third-party library (e.g., [parallel_tests in Ruby](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests)).

Happy Testing!
