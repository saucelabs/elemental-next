# How To Take A Screenshot on Failure

## Intro

With browser tests it can often be challenging to track down the issue that caused a failure.

By itself, a failure message along with a stack trace is hardly enough to go on, especially when you run the test again and it passes. You may or may not be able to recreate that initial error message, and might be left wondering what it was, and whether or not it will cause issues in the future.

## A Solution

A simple way to gain insight into your test failures is to capture screenshots at the moment of failure. This is something that is fairly quick to add to your tests, and allows you to review these error messages.

Here is an example.

## Example

Let's start by importing our requisite libraries and wire up some setup and teardown methods.

```javascript
// filename: test/screenshot.spec.js
const assert = require("assert");
const { Builder, By } = require("selenium-webdriver");
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

describe("Screenshot", function() {
  let driver;

  beforeEach(async function() { this.timeout(60000) driver = await new Builder().forBrowser("chrome").build();
  });

  afterEach(async function() {
    if (this.currentTest.state !== "passed") {
      const testName = this.currentTest.fullTitle().replace(/\s/g, "-");
      const fileName = path.join(__dirname, `screenshot_${testName}.jpg`);
      fs.writeFileSync(fileName, await driver.takeScreenshot(), "base64");
    }
    await driver.quit();
  });
// ...
```

In `afterEach` we check to see if the test was unsuccessful (e.g., `this.currenTest.state !== "passed"`). If not, then the test has either failed or errored and we capture a screenshot through the help of Selenium's `.takeScreenshot()` function. To save it to disk, we use `fs` and its `writeFileSync` function. It takes the full path to save to, the payload (e.g., the screenshot), and the encoding (which for the image is `"base64"`).

To make the filename unique we use the test name after cleaning it up (by replacing spaces with `-`). When this command executes it will save an image file (e.g., `screenshot_Screenshot-on-failure.jpg`) to the local system in the current working directory.

Now to wire up a test which will fail.

```javascript
// filename: test/screenshot.spec.js
// ...
  it("on failure", async function() {
    await driver.get("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com");
    assert(true === false);
  });
});
```

## Expected Behavior

When we save this file and run it (`mocha` from the command-line) here is what will happen:

+ Open the browser
+ Load the homepage of [the-internet](http://github.com/tourdedave/the-internet)
+ Fail on the assertion
+ Capture a screenshot in the current working directory
+ Close the browser

## Summary

Having a screenshot to aid in troubleshooting failing tests along with a stack trace helps in having more insight.

Happy Testing!
