# Using a Page Object

## Intro

One of the biggest challenges with Selenium tests is that they can be brittle and challenging to maintain over time.
This is largely due to the fact that things in the app you're testing change, breaking your tests.

But the reality of a software project is that change is a constant. So we need to account for this reality somehow
in our test code in order to be successful.

import DropdownMarkdown from '../../src/components/dropdownMarkdown';

<DropdownMarkdown folderName='7-use-a-page-object' />
