# Choosing a Locator Strategy

## Intro

In web design CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to apply styles to the markup (HTML) on a page. CSS is able to do this by declaring which bits of the the markup it wants to interact with through the use of selectors. Selenium operates in a similar manner but instead of changing the style of elements it interacts with them by clicking, getting values from, typing, sending keys, etc.

At the heart of Selenium is the ability to interact with a page through its elements by way of various locator strategies. Identifier, Id, Name, Link, DOM, XPath, and CSS -- oh my!

This is the life-blood of your automated tests and there are numerous elements to choose from. But which ones do you use? And when do you use them and why?

import DropdownMarkdown from '../../src/components/dropdownMarkdown';

<DropdownMarkdown folderName='22-locator-strategy' />
