# How to Use Selenium Grid

## Intro

If you're looking to run your tests on different browser and operating system combinations but you're unable to justify using
a third-party solution like [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) or [BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com/) then what
do you do?

import DropdownMarkdown from '../../src/components/dropdownMarkdown';

<DropdownMarkdown folderName='52-grid' />
