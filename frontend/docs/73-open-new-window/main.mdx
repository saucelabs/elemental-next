## Intro

Nearly everyone, at some point during their normal flow of work on the computer, has had to open a new window or tab. In fact, many of us often end up with several tabs open. It makes sense that this should be tested using Selenium.

Previously, you may have sent keystrokes to open a new tab or window with a send keys method and `Command t` (MacOS) or `Control n` (Windows). However, this doesnâ€™t translate well across different operating systems and browser versions.
