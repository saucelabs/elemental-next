# How to Download a File Without a Browser

## Intro

In a [previous tip](/tips/2-download-a-file) we went through how to download files with Selenium by configuring the browser to download them locally and verifying their file size when done.

While the previous method works, it requires a custom configuration that is inconsistent from browser to browser.

Ultimately, we shouldn't care if a file was downloaded or not. Instead, we should care that a file _can_ be downloaded, which we can do by using an HTTP client alongside Selenium in our test.
