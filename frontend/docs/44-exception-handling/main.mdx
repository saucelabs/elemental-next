# How To Handle Exceptions

## Intro

It doesn't take long when using Selenium before you run into errors from Selenium that may seem inexplicable (e.g., `NoSuchElementError` or `StaleElementReferenceError`). They can be a bit of a shock if you're not sure what they are, how to handle them, or where to find documentation on how to address them.
