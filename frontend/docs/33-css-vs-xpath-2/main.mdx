# CSS vs. XPath, Under a Microscope

## Intro

In a previous tip we reviewed [the performance of CSS vs. XPath against Sauce Labs](https://elementalselenium.com/docs/css-vs-xpath/32-css-vs-xpath).
While it demonstrated that each locator strategy is reasonably equivalent across browsers, it didn't adequately paint
the whole picture for us.

Given that it was an end-to-end test there were a lot of variables at play -- Sauce startup, browser start up, and
latency to and from the application under test. The unfortunate takeaway from that experiment could be that one driver
may be faster than the other (e.g. IE vs Firefox), when in fact, that's not the case at all.
