# The Mobile Testing Pyramid

## Intro

>This is a guest post from Kwo Ding. You can follow him on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kwoding/). You can also see a recording of him delivering this material at SauceCon ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACP6N1L62AU)).

When most people start mobile testing, they tend to start with a few real devices and perform exploratory testing manually. Over time, the number of devices grow, but in order to reach fast feedback and lessen the amount of manual testing, a better usage of available tools is necessary.

## A Solution

Mobile testing can be complex, and not only has to cover the UI aspects, but also compatibility of hardware, network connectivity, etc. A few examples of mobile testing challenges are:

- Layout issues
- Device incompatibility
- OS issues
- Network issues
- Authentication issues

Based on my personal mobile testing experience, I came up with the **Mobile Test Pyramid** strategy. Of course, it was inspired by the test pyramid of Mike Cohn ('Succeeding with Agile', 2009). But this doesn't quite cover the detail that is needed for a good mobile testing strategy.

The mobile test pyramid has 3 levels:

- Real devices
- Mobile simulators & emulators
- Desktop browsers (using mobile simulation)


Identical to the generic test pyramid, the broader the layer in the pyramid, the more tests you should have which cover a wider range of complexity.

Here are the focus areas for each layer, along with their pros and cons as I see them.

### Desktop browsers: mobile testing on desktop browsers

| Focus area                | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Functional system testing | Isolated browser tests performing full functional validations              |
| Responsive design         | Resizing browsers and toggling user agents                                 |
| Cross-browser             | Use equivalent desktop browsers                                            |
| Overall visual layout     | No extensive visual checks because the rendering is different than devices |

#### Pros

- Fast execution: Matter of milliseconds to launch a browser, also headless execution is possible.
- Scalable: Easily set up 10+ browser instances per machine.
- Cross platform: Ability to use browsers on different operating systems.

#### Cons

- Mobile simulation uses the desktop browser engine: Mobile simulation in desktop browsers is still using the desktop browser.
- No native integration: No native keyboards, incoming calls, etc.
- Just not a device... Incredibly fast, but still not a real device.

### Mobile simulators/emulators: closer to the actual mobile experience...

**NOTE: Only applicable for iOS and Android.**

| Focus area                | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Functional end-user flows | Click paths throughout the application                                                                          |
| Native API integration    | GPS injection, file attachments, incoming calls etc.                                                            |
| Visuals (vanilla only)    | Use equivalent desktop browsers                                                                                 |
| Overall visual layout     | Emulators are limited to vanilla versions                                                                       |
| Touch interactions        | Touch interactions such as swipe and tap comes closer to the user experience of a device than browser emulation |

#### Pros

- Easy to set up: Simulators/emulators are easy to set up, just download, install, and run.
- Scalable: Virtualization means scalable and also running in parallel on one machine.
- Native API integration: Ability to test native APIs such as incoming calls and GPS injection.
- Simulators or Intel-based emulators are fast: Simulators are fast, because they only have to simulate the software part. Emulators based on the Intel architecture are fast.
- Debugging possibilities: Easy to debug simulator/emulators, already hooked up to the machine to access logs.

#### Cons

- Vanilla versions only: Manufacturer’s skins are available, but the device behavior is still based on what comes stock.
- No real resource usage: CPU/memory usage of machine in case of simulators. Emulators try to simulate the hardware.
- No real interoperability: Connectivity with NFC, Bluetooth, network connections.
- Slow ARM-based emulators: Emulators based on the ARM architecture are slow, which is the main architecture for Android devices.
- Inaccurate color display in light/dark: Contrast/brightness inaccurate in light/dark environment.

### Real devices: the real thing...

| Focus area             | Description                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Usability              | Validating usability such as actual click areas, touch actions and voice over                      |
| Performance            | CPU/memory usage, battery, network strengths                                                       |
| Native API integration | Interruption (incoming calls, push notifications), resource fighting (camera, GPS), NFC, Bluetooth |
| Visuals                | Focus on devices which are not available as simulators/emulators                                   |
| Manufacturer’s sauce   | Real OS from manufacturers, e.g. Samsung's TouchWiz and built-in browsers                          |

#### Pros

- Native APIs in real conditions: Ability to test native APIs not only with injections for automation, but also actual NFC touch for example.
- Can be faster than emulators: Some real devices are just faster than emulators due to the simulation of hardware, especially compared to the ARM-based emulators.
- Just the real thing... Actual network conditions, battery/CPU/memory usage, manufacturer’s secret sauce on top of the OS.

#### Cons

- Costs: Real devices come with a price, usually you pay per device/cradle.
- New device means procurement: A new device is usually not available on-the-fly, even with cloud solutions. E.g. when the new iPhone comes out, it's not available immediately to procure. In the meantime, the iOS simulator would already be available.
- Development iOS build required for automation: iOS apps need to be signed with Development Distribution Certificate and Provisioning Profile for automation.

## Summary

There are loads of trade-offs when it comes to mobile testing. But by learning to use all layers of the mobile testing pyramid to your advantage (leveraging desktop browsers, mobile simulators/emulators, and real devices together) you can gain the fast feedback that is required in modern CI/CD environments. It's just a matter of focusing on the right things in each layer for your context.
