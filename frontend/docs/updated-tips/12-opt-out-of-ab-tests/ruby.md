# How to Opt-out of A/B Tests

## Intro

Occasionally when running tests you may see unexpected behavior due to [A/B testing (a.k.a. split testing)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) of the application you're working with. In order to keep your tests running without issue we need a clean way to opt-out of these split tests.

## A Solution

First, here is a primer on Split Testing.
>### Split Testing
>Split testing is a simple way to experiment with an application's features to see which changes lead to higher user engagement. A simple example would be testing variations of an e-mail landing page to see if more people sign up. In such a split test there would be the control (how the application looks and behaves now) and variants (e.g., 2 or 3 changes that could include changing text or images on the page, element positioning, color of the submit button, etc).
>
>Once the variants are configured, they are put into rotation, and the experiment starts. During this experiment each user will see a different version of the feature and their engagement with it will be tracked. Split tests live for the length of the experiment or until a winner is found (e.g., tracking indicates that a variant converted higher than the control). If no winner is found, new variants may be created and another experiment tried. If a winner is found, then the winning variant becomes the new control and the feature gets updated accordingly.


Thankfully there are some standard opt-out mechanisms built into A/B testing platforms. They tend to come in the form of an appended URL or forging a cookie.

Let's start with an example for each approach with a popular A/B testing platform, [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/).

## Example

Our example page is from [the-internet](http://github.com/tourdedave/the-internet) and can be seen [here](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/abtest). There are three different versions of the page that are available. On each page the heading text will vary:

+ Control: `A/B Test Control`
+ Variation 1: `A/B Test Variation 1`
+ Opt-out: `No A/B Test`

Let's kick things off by loading our requisite libraries (e.g., `selenium-webdriver` to control the browser and `rspec/expectations` and it's matchers for our assertions) and adding some simple `setup`, `teardown`, and `run` methods to handle our test configuration.

```ruby
# filename: split_test.rb

require 'selenium-webdriver'
require 'rspec/expectations'
include ::RSpec::Matchers

def setup
  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox
end

def teardown
  @driver.quit
end

def run
  setup
  yield
  teardown
end
```

Now let's wire up our first test to step through loading the split testing page and verifying that the text changes as we forge an opt-out cookie.

```ruby
run do
  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/abtest'
  heading_text = @driver.find_element(css: 'h3').text
  expect(['A/B Test Variation 1', 'A/B Test Control'].include? heading_text).to eql true
  @driver.manage.add_cookie(name: 'optimizelyOptOut', value: 'true')
  @driver.navigate.refresh
  heading_text = @driver.find_element(css: 'h3').text
  expect(heading_text).to eql('No A/B Test')
end
```

After navigating to the page we confirm that we are in one of the A/B test groups by grabbing the heading text and checking to see if it matches what we expect. After that we add the opt-out cookie, refresh the page, and then confirm that we are no longer in the A/B test group by checking the heading text again.

We could also load the opt-out cookie before navigating to this page.

```ruby
run do
  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com'
  @driver.manage.add_cookie(name: 'optimizelyOptOut', value: 'true')
  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/abtest'
  expect(@driver.find_element(css: 'h3').text).to eql('No A/B Test')
end
```

Here we first navigate to the main page of the site and then add the opt-out cookie. After that, we navigate to the split test page and perform our checks. Alternatively, we could opt out without forging a cookie. Instead we would need to append an opt out request to the URL.

```ruby
run do
  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/abtest?optimizely_opt_out=true'
  @driver.switch_to.alert.dismiss
  expect(@driver.find_element(css: 'h3').text).to eql('No A/B Test')
end
```

By appending `?optimizely_opt_out=true` we achieve the same outcome as before. Keep in mind that this approach triggers a JavaScript alert, so we have to switch to and dismiss it (e.g., `@driver.switch_to.alert.dismiss`) before performing our check.

## Expected Behavior

If you save this file and run it (e.g., `ruby split_test.rb` from the command-line) here is what will happen:

+ Open the browser
+ Opt-out of the split tests (either by cookie or appended URL)
+ Visit the split testing page
+ Grab the header text
+ Confirm that the session is opted out of the split tests
+ Close the browser

## Summary

Hopefully this tip was helpful in guiding you in different methods of how to opt out of split tests.

Happy Testing!
