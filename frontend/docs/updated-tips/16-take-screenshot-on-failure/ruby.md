# How to Take A Screenshot on Failure

## Intro

With browser tests it can often be challenging to track down the issue that caused a failure.

By itself, a failure message along with a stack trace is hardly enough to go on, especially when you run the test again and it passes. You may or may not be able to recreate that initial error message, and might be left wondering what it was, and whether or not it will cause issues in the future.

## A Solution

A simple way to gain insight into your test failures is to capture screenshots at the moment of failure. This is something that is fairly quick to add to your tests, and allows you to review these error messages.

Here is an example.

## Example

Let's start by including our requisite libraries (`selenium-webdriver` to drive the browser and `rspec/expectations` & `RSpec::Matchers` for our assertion) and wire up some simple `setup` and `teardown` methods.

```ruby
# filename: screenshot.rb

require 'selenium-webdriver'
require 'rspec/expectations'
include RSpec::Matchers

def setup
  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox
end

def teardown
  @driver.quit
end
```

Next we'll want to create a method to execute our tests. This is where we'll capture when a failure occurs and take a screenshot.

```ruby
def run
  setup
  begin
    yield
  rescue RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError => error
    puts error.message
    @driver.save_screenshot "./#{Time.now.strftime("failshot__%d_%m_%Y__%H_%M_%S")}.png"
  end
  teardown
end
```

After calling `setup` and before calling `teardown` we wrap our test code execution (e.g., `yield`) in a `rescue` block. This handles the exception that a test failure will return. When a failure occurs the error message will get outputted to the terminal (just like it normally would) but now we are also capturing a screenshot through the help of Selenium's `.save_screenshot` method.

`.save_screenshot` accepts a filename as a string (e.g., `'failshot.png'`). When this command executes it will save an image file to your local system in the current working directory.

Note the use of `Time.now.strftime` in the screenshot filename. This is adding a timestamp (down to the second) to the filename. This provides a (reasonably) unique file name and has the added benefit of listing the files in the order taken.

Now let's wire up our test.

```ruby
run do
  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com'
  expect(@driver.find_element(css: 'h1').text).to eql 'blah blah blah'
end
```

## Expected Behavior

If we save this file and run it (`ruby screenshot.rb` from the command-line) here is what would happen:

+ Open the browser
+ Load the homepage of [the-internet](http://github.com/tourdedave/the-internet)
+ Check the text of the page header and fail
+ Output a failure message in the terminal
+ Capture a timestamped screenshot in the current working directory
+ Close the browser

## Summary

For more info on `strftime` (a.k.a. String Formatted Time) go [here](http://apidock.com/ruby/DateTime/strftime).

But if you want truly unique filenames, then you should use a unique ID in the filename instead of a timestamp (e.g., something like [`uuid`](https://github.com/assaf/uuid)). This will prevent screenshots from getting overwritten when you have two (or more) tests taking screenshots at the same time.
