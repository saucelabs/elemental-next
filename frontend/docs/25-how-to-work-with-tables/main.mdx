# How to Work with HTML Data Tables

## Intro

Odds are at some point you've come across the use of tables in a web application to display data or information to a user, giving them the option to sort and manipulate it. Depending on your application it can be quite common and something you will want to write an automated test for.

When the table has no helpful, semantic markup (e.g. easy to use `id` or `class` attributes) it quickly becomes more difficult to work with and write tests against it. And if you're able to pull something together, it will likely not work against older browsers.
