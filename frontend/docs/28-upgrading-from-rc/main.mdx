# How to Upgrade from Selenium RC to WebDriver

## Intro

As the Selenium project continues to evolve, Selenium RC is moving closer to end-of-life. This is especially
true with the upcoming release of Selenium 3 where minimal support will be offered for RC (details of which you
can learn more about from [a Selenium Hangout with Simon Stewart](https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2013/selenium-hangout-2-recap/)).

But how do you approach an upgrade like this? Especially if you have an enormous amount of Selenium RC tests that you rely on?
