# How to Upload a File

## Intro

Uploading a file is a common piece of functionality found on the web but when trying to automate it, you get prompted with a dialog box that is just out of reach for Selenium.

In these cases people often look to a third-party tool to manipulate this window (e.g., [AutoIt](http://www.toolsqa.com/selenium-webdriver/autoit-selenium-webdriver/)). While this can help solve your short-term need, it sets you up for failure later by chaining you to a specific platform (e.g., AutoIt only works on Windows), effectively limiting your ability to test this functionality on different browser & operating system combinations.
