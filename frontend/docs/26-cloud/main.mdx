# How to Run Your Tests on Any Browser & Operating System

## Intro

In order to test features in a previous version of Chrome, you would need to run a virtual machine (VM) on your computer with a "legit" version of Windows installed on the VM.

Now what about when the other half of your users use Chrome and Safari on macOS, and maybe other operating systems? What if you need
to run those tests in parallel and scale up the number of VMs available? Then you're looking at provisioning, running, and
maintaining your own farm of machines and standing up something like [Selenium Grid](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/grid/)
to coordinate tests across them.

And all you wanted to do was run your tests on the browsers you cared about... but there's a better solution to all of this.
