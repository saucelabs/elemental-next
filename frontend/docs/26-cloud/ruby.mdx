# How to Run Your Tests on Any Browser & Operating System

## Intro

In order to test features in a previous version of Chrome, you would need to run a virtual machine (VM) on your computer with a "legit" version of Windows installed on the VM.

Now what about when the other half of your users use Chrome and Safari on macOS, and maybe other operating systems? What if you need
to run those tests in parallel and scale up the number of VMs available? Then you're looking at provisioning, running, and
maintaining your own farm of machines and standing up something like [Selenium Grid](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/grid/)
to coordinate tests across them.

And all you wanted to do was run your tests on the browsers you cared about... but there's a better solution to all of this.

## A Solution

Rather than take on the overhead of a test infrastructure, you can easily outsource things to a third-party cloud provider
(a.k.a. Someone Elses Grid). There are a handful of players in this space, but there's one that stands out --
[Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/).

At the heart of Selenium at scale is the use of Selenium Grid. Selenium Grid lets you distribute test execution across
several machines and you connect to it with [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/).
With Selenium WebDriver you specify the browser type, browser version, and operating system.

This is fundamentally how Sauce Labs works. Behind the curtain they are ultimately running Selenium Grid, and they
receive and execute your tests through Selenium WebDriver.

Here is an example.

## Example


**NOTE**: You'll need an account to use Sauce Labs. You can sign up for a
[free trial account (no credit-card required)](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up).

First we'll include our dependent libraries (to drive the browser and do assertions), and wire up some simple
`setup`, `teardown`, and `run` methods. We recommend exporting your Sauce Labs `SAUCE_USERNAME` and
`SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` as environment variables.

Here are instructions for setting environment variables on each Operating System:

* [Windows](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/08/31/how-to-change-environment-variables-on-windows-10/)
* [macOS](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106778/how-do-i-set-environment-variables-on-os-x)
* [Linux](https://askubuntu.com/questions/58814/how-do-i-add-environment-variables)

```ruby
# filename: cloud.rb

require 'selenium-webdriver'
require 'rspec/expectations'
include RSpec::Matchers

def setup
  options = Selenium::WebDriver::Options.chrome
  options.browser_version = '109'
  options.platform_name = 'macOS 13'
  sauce_options = {}
  sauce_options[:name] = 'Elemental Selenium - Tip 26 - Hello!'
  options.add_option('sauce:options', sauce_options)

  url = "https://#{ENV['SAUCE_USERNAME']}:#{ENV['SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY']}@ondemand.us-west-1.saucelabs.com:443/wd/hub"
  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for(:remote, :url => url, :capabilities => options)
end

def teardown
  @driver.quit
end

def run
  setup
  yield
  teardown
end
```

Our `setup` method is where the magic is happening. We declare the browser options
for Chrome and store it in a variable for immediate reuse. We then set the browser version
(e.g. `options.browser_version = '109'`, but you can also use `latest` to use the most recent
version), specify the operating system we would like to use (e.g. `options.platform_name = 'macOS 13'`),
and set the test name (e.g., `sauce_options[:name] = 'Elemental Selenium - Tip 26 - Hello!'`).

We then connect to Sauce Labs with Selenium WebDriver and feed in our browser options object.

**NOTE**: The URL contains the URI for the Sauce Labs cl service as well as our Sauce user and
access credentials. In this case, they are specified through environment variables. But you can
just as easily hard-code your info here. We recommend exporting your Sauce Labs `SAUCE_USERNAME` and
`SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` as environment variables.

Here are instructions for setting environment variables on each Operating System:

* [Windows](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/08/31/how-to-change-environment-variables-on-windows-10/)
* [macOS](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106778/how-do-i-set-environment-variables-on-os-x)
* [Linux](https://askubuntu.com/questions/58814/how-do-i-add-environment-variables)

Now we're ready to add a test to run in Sauce Labs.

```ruby
run do
  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com'
  expect(@driver.title.include?('The Internet')).to eql true
end
```

If we save this and run it (e.g., `ruby cloud.rb` from the command-line) it will execute the test on
an Chrome 109 browser instance running on macOS 13 (Ventura) in Sauce Labs.

## Another Browser

If you want to change up the browser, you would just need to alter the options:

```ruby
  # For Chrome 110
  options = Selenium::WebDriver::Options.chrome
  options.browser_version = '110'
```

Or...

```ruby
  # For Safari 16
  options = Selenium::WebDriver::Options.safari
  options.browser_version = '16'
```

Or...

```ruby
  # For Edge 109
  options = Selenium::WebDriver::Options.edge
  options.browser_version = '109'
```

**NOTE**: You can find a full list of configuration options along with example code for all of Sauce supported
languages at their [Platform Configurator](https://saucelabs.com/products/platform-configurator#/).

## Expected Behavior

- Open a specified browser in Sauce Labs
- Test runs
- Browser closes
- Test results (along with a video recording, screenshots, and other debugging information) are available on the
[test results dashboard](https://docs.saucelabs.com/test-results/viewing-test-results/).

## Summary

Hopefully this tip has helped you get your tests up and running against numerous browsers.

There are some other things to consider when using Sauce Labs (e.g., testing your secure apps through
[Sauce Connect](https://docs.saucelabs.com/secure-connections/sauce-connect/), setting the pass/fail status
for your tests, and dynamically setting the test name). You can find more information about these things
in [the Sauce Labs docs](https://docs.saucelabs.com/).

Happy Testing!
