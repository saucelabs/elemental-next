# How To Download a File

## Intro

Just like with [uploading files](/docs/how-to-upload-a-file/) we hit the same issue with downloading them -- a dialog box
just out of Selenium's reach. With some additional configuration, we can side-step the dialog box.

import DropdownMarkdown from '../../src/components/dropdownMarkdown';

<DropdownMarkdown folderName='2-download-a-file' />
