# How to Test Checkboxes

## Intro

Checkboxes are an often used element in web applications. This guide will show you how to work with them in your Selenium tests.

Intuitively you may reach for a method that has the word 'checked' in it -- like `.checked` or `.is_checked` but this doesn't exist in Selenium.
