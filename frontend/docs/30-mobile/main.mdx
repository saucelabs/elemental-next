# How to Test Your Mobile App

## Intro

__NOTE: This post is outdated. I've written a more current series of getting started posts for mobile testing
with Appium. You can find them [here](https://saucelabs.com/resources/articles/appium-bootcamp-chapter-1).__

## Use Case

Mobile is kind of a big deal. And if you haven't needed to test a mobile app yet, it's only a matter of time.
But where do you start? And how do you do it in a way that is complimentary to your existing automation and experience?

import DropdownMarkdown from '../../src/components/dropdownMarkdown';

<DropdownMarkdown folderName='30-mobile' />
