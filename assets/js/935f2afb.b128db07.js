But that\'s not always easy to accomplish.

So how do you test this functionality?","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"safari/69-safari-driver":{"id":"safari/69-safari-driver","title":"SafariDriver","description":"Since Selenium 2.45.0, in order to use SafariDriver, you need to manually install the SafariDriver browser extension.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"select-from-a-dropdown/5-select-from-a-dropdown":{"id":"select-from-a-dropdown/5-select-from-a-dropdown","title":"How to Select from a Dropdown List","description":"Some common use cases for selecting from a dropdown list might be selecting sizes or styles from a dropdown menu while online shopping, or selecting your method of payment.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"tagging/58-tagging":{"id":"tagging/58-tagging","title":"Tagging","description":"As your test suite grows you\'ll likely employ some kind of folder structure to help make sense of everything -- grouping similar tests together.

By itself, a failure message along with a stack trace is hardly enough to go on, especially when you run the test again and it passes. You may or may not be able to recreate that initial error message, and might be left wondering what it was, and whether or not it will cause issues in the future.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"upgrading-from-rc/28-upgrading-from-rc":{"id":"upgrading-from-rc/28-upgrading-from-rc","title":"How to Upgrade from Selenium RC to WebDriver","description":"As the Selenium project continues to evolve, Selenium RC is moving closer to end-of-life.
