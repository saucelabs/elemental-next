We then create a `SetUp()` method with a `[TestInitialize]` attribute, so it runs before our test. In this\nmethod we are creating an instance of WebDriver with Firefox (e.g., `_driver = new FirefoxDriver();`).\n\nAfter our test executes, the `TearDown()` method will run thanks to the `[TestCleanup]` attribute. This\ncalls `_driver?.Quit();` which will close the browser instance.\n\n### The Test\n\nLines 29 to 37 are the test itself.\n\nWe create an `UploadFileFromDisk()` method and add a `[TestMethod]` attribute, so it is run as a test. In it, we leverage\na file from local disk by specifying the file (e.g., `SomeFile.txt`) and its path (e.g., the file is assumed to be in\nthe same directory as the test).\n\nNext we visit the page with the upload form, input the string value of `uploadFile` (e.g., the full path to the file\nplus the filename with its extension), and submit the form. After the file is uploaded to the page it will display the\nfilename it just processed. We use this text to perform our assertion (making sure the uploaded file is what we expect).\n\n### Executing the Test\n\nBefore executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the project file (e.g.,\n`csharp.csproj` in this case).\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>csharp.csproj</code> file.</summary>\n    <div>\n        <TipCode codePath={"1-upload-a-file/code/csharp/csharp.csproj"} language={"xml"}/>\n    </div>\n</details>\n\nFinally, we can run the test by executing `dotnet test` from the command-line.\n\n'},78522:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='import TipCode from "@site/src/components/tipCode";\n\n## TL;DR - Show Me The Code\n\n<TipCode codePath={"1-upload-a-file/code/java/src/test/java/com/elemental/selenium/UploadTest.java"} language={"java"}/>\n\n## Code Walkthrough\n\n### Importing Libraries\n\nLines 3 to 10 are pulling in our requisite classes for annotations (e.g., `org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach`, etc.),\ndriving the browser with Selenium (e.g., `org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver`, etc.), matchers for assertions\n(e.g., `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;`, etc. ), and something to handle local files (e.g., `java.io.File`).\n\n### Setup and Teardown\n\nLines 15 to 25 are setting up and tearing down the browser instance. The `beforeEach` method, will execute before\neach test. In it, we are launching a new instance of Firefox with Selenium and storing it in a class variable that\nwe\'ll use throughout all tests. After our test executes the second method, `afterEach`, will execute. This calls\n`driver.quit()` which ends the session by closing the browser instance.\n\n### The Test\n\nLines 29 to 36 are the test itself.\n\nWe create an `uploadFile()` method and annotate it with `@Test` so it is run as a test. In it, we create a new file\ncalled `some-file.txt` in the present working directory and get it\'s absolute path.\n\nNext we visit the page with the upload form, input the string value of `path` (e.g., the full path to the file plus the\nfilename with it\'s extension), and submit the form. After the file is uploaded to the page it will display the filename\nit just processed. We use this text to perform our assertion (making sure the uploaded file is what we expect).\n\n### Executing the Test\n\nBefore executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `pom.xml` file.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>pom.xml</code> file.</summary>\n    <div>\n        <TipCode codePath={"1-upload-a-file/code/java/pom.xml"} language={"xml"}/>\n    </div>\n</details>\n\nFinally, we can run the test by executing `mvn test` from the command-line.'},9939:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='import TipCode from "@site/src/components/tipCode";\n\n## TL;DR - Show Me The Code\n\n<TipCode codePath={"1-upload-a-file/code/javascript/test/upload.spec.js"} language={"js"}/>\n\n## Code Walkthrough\n\n### Importing Libraries\n\nLines 1 to 3 are pulling in our requisite classes for interacting with the operating system (e.g., `require("path");`),\nour testing framework (e.g., `mocha` and `require("assert")`), and driving the browser with\nSelenium (e.g., `const {Builder, By} = require("selenium-webdriver");`).\n\n### Setup and Teardown\n\nAfter creating a `describe` to group our tests (e.g., `describe("Upload Test")...`), lines 8 to 14 are setting up and\ntearing down the browser instance.\n\nThe `beforeEach` method, will execute before each test. In it, we are launching a new instance of Firefox with\nSelenium and storing it in a class variable that we\'ll use throughout all tests. After our test executes the second\nmethod, `afterEach`, will execute. This calls `driver.quit()` which ends the session by closing the browser instance.\n\n### The Test\n\nLines 17 to 25 are the test itself.\n\nAfter declaring the test method (e.g., `it("upload a file")...`) we specify the name of file we\'d like to upload. It\'s\na text file called `some-file.txt` in the current working directory. We determine the path to this file and store it\nin a variable called `filePath`.\n\nNext we visit the page with the upload form, input the string value of `filePath`, and click the submit button on the\nform. After the file is uploaded to the page it will display the filename it just processed. We use this text on the\npage to perform our assertion (making sure the uploaded file is what we expect).\n\n### Executing the Test\n\nBefore executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `package.json` file.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>package.json</code> file.</summary>\n    <div>\n        <TipCode codePath={"1-upload-a-file/code/javascript/package.json"} language={"json"}/>\n    </div>\n</details>\n\nFinally, we can run the test by executing `npm test` from the command-line.\n'},19300:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='import TipCode from "@site/src/components/tipCode";\n\n## TL;DR - Show Me The Code\n\n<TipCode codePath={"1-upload-a-file/code/python/upload.py"} language={"python"}/>\n\n## Code Walkthrough\n\n### Importing Libraries\n\nLines 1 to 4 are pulling in our requisite libraries for interacting with the operating system (e.g., `import os`), our\ntesting framework (e.g., `import pytest`), driving the browser with Selenium (e.g., `from selenium import webdriver`),\nand a locator strategy to find the elements (e.g. `from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By`).\n\n### Setup and Teardown\n\nLines 6 to 10 are setting up and tearing down the browser instance. The `@pytest.fixture` decorator is used to create a\nfixture that sets up and tears down the browser. The `yield` keyword is used to pause the fixture until the test is\ncompleted. After the test is completed, the fixture resumes and executes the teardown code\n(in this case, `driver.quit()`).\n\n### The Test\n\nLines 12 to 20 are the test itself.\n\nThe fixture that sets up and tears down the browser is used as an argument in the test\n`test_file_upload(driver_setup_teardown)`, which allows the test to have access to the browser provided by the fixture.\n\nAfter declaring the test method (e.g., `def test_file_upload(driver_setup_teardown):`) we store `driver_setup_teardown`\nin a local variable (e.g., `driver = driver_setup_teardown`). This way we don\'t have to litter our test method with\n`driver_setup_teardown` and can call `driver` instead. Next we specify the file we\'d like to upload. There\'s already a\ntext file called `some-file.txt` in the current working directory, so we grab both the file name and its full path,\nstoring both of these values in variables (e.g., `filename` and `file` respectively).\n\nNext we visit the page with the upload form, input the string value of `file` (e.g., the full path to the file plus the\nfilename with its extension), and submit the form. After the file is uploaded to the page it will display the filename\nit just processed. We use this text on the page to perform our assertion (making sure the uploaded file is what we\nexpect).\n\n### Executing the Test\n\nBefore executing the test, we need to install the required libraries. We can do this by running\n`pip install -r requirements.txt` from the command-line. The `requirements.txt` file contains the libraries we\nneed to install.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>requirements.txt</code> file.</summary>\n    <div>\n        <TipCode codePath={"1-upload-a-file/code/python/requirements.txt"} language={"txt"}/>\n    </div>\n</details>\n\nAfter installing the required libraries, we can run the test by executing `pytest upload.py` from the command-line.\n\n\n\n\n'},25082:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='import TipCode from "@site/src/components/tipCode";\n\n## TL;DR - Show Me The Code\n\n<TipCode codePath={"1-upload-a-file/code/ruby/upload.rb"} language={"ruby"}/>\n\n## Code Walkthrough\n\n### Importing Libraries\n\nLines 1 to 3 are pulling in our requisite classes (e.g., `selenium-webdriver` to drive the browser,\nand `rspec/expectations` & `RSpec::Matchers` for our assertion).\n\n### Setup and Teardown\n\n\nLines 5 to 11 are setting up and tearing down the browser instance. We\'re using the `setup` method to launch a new\ninstance of Firefox with Selenium and storing it in a class variable that we\'ll use throughout all tests. After our\ntest executes the `teardown` method will execute. This calls `driver.quit()` which ends the session by closing the\nbrowser instance.\n\nThe `run` method is a custom method that we\'ve defined to execute our test. It\'s a simple wrapper around the `setup`\nand `teardown` methods. We\'re using it to keep our test code clean and easy to read.\n\n### The Test\n\nLines 18 to 28 are the test itself.\n\nAfter specifying the `filename` we get the full path to the file (which we\'re doing with\n`File.join(Dir.pwd, filename)`). This approach assumes that the file is living in the same directory as the test\nscript.\n\nNext we visit the page with the upload form, input the `file` text (e.g., the full path to the file plus the filename\nwith it\'s extension), and submit the form. After the file is uploaded the page will display the filename that it just\nprocessed. We use this text to perform our assertion (making sure the uploaded file is what we expect).\n\n### Executing the Test\n\nBefore executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `Gemfile` file.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>Gemfile</code> file.</summary>\n    <div>\n        <TipCode codePath={"1-upload-a-file/code/ruby/Gemfile"} language={"txt"}/>\n    </div>\n</details>\n\n\nFinally, we can run the test by executing `ruby upload.rb` from the command-line.\n'},77201:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='import TipCode from "@site/src/components/tipCode";\n\n## TL;DR - Show Me The Code\n\n<TipCode codePath={"1-upload-a-file/code/selenide/src/test/java/com/elemental/selenium/UploadTest.java"}\n         language={"java"}/>\n\n## Code Walkthrough\n\n### Importing Libraries\n\nLines 3 to 7 are pulling in our requisite classes\n * for annotations (e.g., `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test`),\n * opening the browser with Selenide (e.g., `com.codeborne.selenide.Selenide.open`),\n * matchers for assertions (e.g., `com.codeborne.selenide.Condition.text`)\n * etc.\n\nNB! You don\'t need to add the typical "selenium*" dependencies.  \nJust one dependency is enough: `com.codeborne:selenide`.\nIt will pull down all the needed Selenium dependencies automatically.\n\n### Setup and Teardown\n\nNext, we open a browser with given URL.\n\nUnder the hood, Selenide performs all the needed tasks:\n* detects the browser (can be customized if needed),\n* setups commons browser settings (can be customized if needed)\n\nNo teardown is needed because Selenide automatically closes the browser when the test finishes.\n\n### The Test\n\nWe call `uploadFileFromClasspath()` method and annotate it with `@Test` so it is run as a test.\n\nNext, we visit the page with the upload form, find the input allowing to upload files, and submit the form.\n\nAfter the file is uploaded to the page it will display the filename it just processed.\nWe use this text to perform our assertion (making sure the uploaded file is what we expect).\n\nNB! "Classpath" is a special folder in Java that (among others) contains all files from the\nfolder `src/test/resources`.\n\nThat\'s why we store the file we want to upload to folder `src/test/resources` and call method `uploadFromClasspath`.\n\n### An Alternative test\n\nIf you want to avoid the term "classpath", or prefer to store test files in some other folders,\nyou can call method `uploadFile` explicitly specifying file path.\n\n### Executing the Test\n\nBefore executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `pom.xml` file.\n\n<details>\n

prompted\nwith a dialog box that is just out of reach of your automation script.\n\nIn these cases people often look to a third-party tool to manipulate this window (e.g., [AutoIt](https://www.toolsqa.com/selenium-webdriver/autoit-selenium-webdriver/)). While this\ncan help solve your short-term need, it sets you up for failure later by chaining you to a specific platform (e.g.,\nAutoIt only works on Windows), effectively limiting your ability to test this functionality on different browser &\noperating system combinations.\n\n## A Solution\n\nA work-around for this problem is to side-step the system dialog box entirely. We can do this by inserting\nthe full path of the file we want to upload (as text) into the form and then submit the form.\n\nLet\'s step through an example.\n\n## Example\n\n__NOTE:__ We are using [a file upload example](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/upload) found on [the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet).\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from \'@site/src/components/displayTips\';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: \'Python\', value: \'python\'},\n    {label: \'C#\', value: \'csharp\'},\n    {label: \'Java\', value: \'java\'},\n    {label: \'JavaScript\', value: \'javascript\'},\n    {label: \'Ruby\', value: \'ruby\'},\n    {label: \'Selenide\', value: \'selenide\'},\n]}/>\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nAfter executing the test, this is what will happen:\n\n+ Open the browser\n+ Visit the upload form page\n+ Inject the file path into the form and submit it\n+ Page displays the uploaded filename\n+ Grab the text from the page and assert it\'s what we expect\n+ Close the browser\n\n## Outro\n\nThis approach will work across all browsers. If you want to use it with a remote instance (e.g., on\n[Selenium Grid](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/grid/) or [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/)) then you\'ll want to have a look at [remote uploads](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/drivers/remote_webdriver/#uploads).\n\nHappy Testing!\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nimport DefaultAvatar from "@site/src/components/defaultAvatar";\n\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Mike Millgate"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/trabulmonkee.png"}\n    description={"Contributed the Python code for this tip."}\n    url={"https://github.com/trabulmonkee"}\n/>\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Isaul Vargas"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/isaulv.png"}\n    description={"Python code review"}\n    url={"https://github.com/isaulv"}\n/>\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Peter Bittner"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/bittner.png"}\n    description={"Python code review"}\n    url={"https://github.com/bittner"}\n/>\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Jonathan Taylor"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/jtay2380.png"}\n    description={"Contributed the initial C# code for this tip."}\n    url={"https://github.com/jtay2380"}\n/>\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Manoj Kumar"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/manoj9788.png"}\n    description={"Contributed the initial JavaScript code for this tip."}\n    url={"https://github.com/manoj9788"}\n/>\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Roman Isko"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/sturman.png"}\n    description={"Contributed the initial Java code for this tip."}\n    url={"https://github.com/sturman"}\n/>\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Andrei Solntsev"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/asolntsev.png"}\n    description={"Contributed the Selenide code for this tip."}\n    url={"https://github.com/asolntsev"}\n/>\n\n## Authors\n\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Dave Piacente"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/tourdedave.png"}\n    description={"Original creator of Elemental Selenium"}\n    url={"https://github.com/tourdedave"}\n    author={true}\n/>\n\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Diego Molina"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/diemol.png"}\n    description={"Current maintainer of Elemental Selenium"}\n    url={"https://github.com/diemol"}\n    author={true}\n/>\n\n'},53213:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="## Example\n\nThe example application is a page that displays a notification message at the top of the page. It will either say **Action successful** or **Action unsuccessful, please try again**. You can see it [here](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/notification_message).\n\nOur goal in this example is verify an **Action successful** message.\n\nThe beginning of our test script starts off simply with accessing our libraries (Selenium and RSpec) and creating our setup, teardown, and run actions.\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rspec/expectations'\n\ndef setup\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n```\n\nA first pass at this example would look something like this:\n\n```ruby\nrun {\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/notification_message'\n  notification_message = @driver.find_element(id: 'flash').text\n  notification_message =~ /Action successful/\n}\n```\n\nThe problem with this approach is that it will fail intermittently because the page's notification message could very well be something else. But the next time you load it, it could be the correct thing.\n\nPerhaps something like this would be better suited:\n\n```ruby\ndef get_notification_message\n  @notification_message = @driver.find_element(id: 'flash').text\nend\n\ndef retry_if_notification_message_contains(fail_message)\n  count = 0\n  yield\n  until !@notification_message.include? fail_message || count == 3\n    yield\n    count =+ 1\n  end\nend\n\nrun {\n  retry_if_notification_message_contains 'please try again' do\n    @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/notification_message'\n    get_notification_message\n  end\n  @notification_message =~ /Action successful/\n}\n```\n\nIn this approach we have abstracted out the text grab of the notification message into a method which sets what it finds into an instance variable. And we've added a new method called `retry_if_notification_message_contains` that accepts an argument of `fail_message`. In it, we accept a yield in 2 places and have constructed a simple loop that runs 3 times or until the notification message does not match the `fail_message`, whichever comes first. And the yields will execute whatever code is passed both before and during the loop.\n\nIn the run block we pass our navigation and text grab actions as a block into `retry_if_notification_message_contains`, passing the failure message of **please try again** as the argument for `fail_message` to receive.\n\nAnd we top everything off with an assertion.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n- Load the page\n- Grab the notification message text\n- Compare it to the failure message\n- If it matches, retry\n- If 3 retries attempted, end loop, and fail test\n- If it doesn't match, pass the test\n\n## Summary\n\nWith this approach there may be a concern that we could be obfuscating a real issue that could bubble up to our users. That's why it is important to use this approach sparingly, and on issues you more or less understand (e.g. a third-party test environment having one-off service blips, or expensive tests that involve sharing something to a third-party and checking to see that it appeared).\n\nHopefully this example will help you build a more resilient and relevant set of tests.\n\nHappy Testing!"},47383:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'Retry Test Actions'\nid: '10-retry-test-actions'\nslug: /10-retry-test-actions\nsidebar_label: Retry Test Actions\ndescription: \"We all write tests with the best intention of having them pass and, when they fail, to reveal legitimate issues in the application we're testing.

And `chomp` removes the carriage return character (e.g. '\\n') from the input.\n\nBefore executing the input we perform a check to see if the letter **q** is issued.

However, if you run into a complicated scenario to automate,\nit becomes challenging to work through it to completion.\n\nThe typical approach is to walk through the scenario manually and inspect its markup, identify the parts you want to\ninteract with, write up the test script, run it, and watch it. If it passes, then pat yourself on the back. If it\nfails, make some tweaks and run it again -- repeating until it passes.\n\nThis is a real pain, and it's even more frustrating when debugging tests that fail intermittently.\n\n## A Solution\n\nOne way to simplify things, and make it easier for testers to transition from Selenium IDE, is to build an interactive\nprompt -- also known as a read-eval-print-loop (REPL).\n\nUpon loading the prompt it will launch a browser and accept Selenium commands just the same as they are written in\ntest code. And if a command is issued that errors (or that it doesn't recognize) the prompt will provide that\ninformation and continue to function.\n\nThis will enable us to continue through specific Selenium actions and locators to verify that they work before\nputting them into test code.\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals.

In order to keep your tests running without issue we need a clean way to opt-out\nof these split tests.\n\n## A Solution\n\nFirst, here is a primer on Split Testing.\n\n> ### Split Testing\n\n> Split testing is a simple way to experiment with an application's features to see which changes lead to higher user\n> engagement. A simple example would be testing variations of an e-mail landing page to see if more people sign up.\n> In such a split test there would be the control (how the application looks and behaves now) and variants (e.g., 2\n> or 3 changes that could include changing text or images on the page, element positioning, color of the submit\n> button, etc.). Once the variants are configured, they are put into rotation, and the experiment starts. During this\n> experiment each user will see a different version of the feature and their engagement with it will be tracked. Split\n> tests live for the length of the experiment or until a winner is found (e.g., tracking indicates that a variant\n> converted higher than the control). If no winner is found, new variants may be created and another experiment tried.\n> If a winner is found, then the winning variant becomes the new control and the feature gets updated accordingly.\n\nThankfully there are some standard opt-out mechanisms built into A/B testing platforms. They tend to come in the\nform of an appended URL or forging a cookie.\n\nLet's start with an example for each approach with a popular A/B testing platform, [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/).\n\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},\n    {label: 'C#', value: 'csharp'},\n    {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},\n    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript'},\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals.

While this is useful, \nit leaves much to be desired, and [an excellent alternative](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/irb_Alternatives) is the [Pry gem](http://pryrepl.org). It not only lets you execute \nRuby commands to test your input and output, but it also allows you to _pry_ inside your code and interact with it \nwhile running.\n\nYou can use the Pry gem to help you construct your scripts (like a simple REPL), but you can also use it as a \nhelpful debugging tool.\n\nTo install Pry, you can either add it to your Gemfile like so:\n\n```ruby\nsource \'https://rubygems.org\'\n\ngem \'pry\'\n```\n\nAnd then run `bundle install`. Or, you can install it from the commandline with `gem install pry`.\n\n## Example\n\nHere I will walk you through a real life example of how I recently used Pry to debug an issue in one of my test scripts.\n\nTo give you some context, here is a simple example of some of my test code.\n\n```ruby\ninclude SiteCheckers\n\n@driver.get("http://www.mysite.com")\n\neverything_ready.should == true\n\n# ... other code that tests other aspects of the site\n```\n\nWe include a module of helpful methods for use in our scripts by including `SiteCheckers`. We assume that the driver \nis already setup and our tests are using Rspec. And `everything_ready` is a method mixed in from `SiteCheckers`. \nIt dynamically checks the page to ensure that we are on the right one and that it is rendered correctly.\n\nWith this context in mind, here is the specific example I was working with recently:\n\n```ruby\ninclude SiteCheckers\ninclude FeatureItems\n\n@driver.get("http://www.mysite.com/some-feature")\neverything_ready.should == true\n\n# ... other code that tests other aspects of the feature\n```\n\nUh oh. When I ran this test, I got an error.\n\n```ruby\nRSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError: expected: true\n     got: nil (using ==)\n```\n\nThat is real funny, because when I looked at the code for this method, nothing should have caused it to return nil:\n\n```ruby\nmodule SiteCheckers\n\ndef everything_ready\n  # redacted code checks to ensure the page is rendered\n  # and raises error if there is an issue\n  true\nend\n\n# ... other helper methods defined here\n\nend\n```\n\nSo, what did I do to solve this issue? I used Pry to debug the error and discover my real issue!\n\nTo initialize Pry in your code, you have to require the gem, and then place `binding.pry` wherever you want \nexecution of your code to pause, so you can jump in and look around for yourself. For example:\n\n```ruby\nrequire \'pry\'\n\ninclude SiteCheckers\ninclude FeatureItems\n\n@driver.get("http://www.mysite.com/some-feature")\n\n# With this, we jump right in before the error in the script\nbinding.pry\n\neverything_ready.should == true\n```\n\nAnd when we run the test, we will get a prompt like this:\n\n```ruby\nFrame number: 0/1\n\nFrom: /home/bgoad/es-pry/pry_test.rb @ line 38 :\n\n    33:     include FeatureItems\n    34:\n    35:     @driver.get("http://www.mysite.com/some-feature")\n    36:\n    37:     # We\'ll jump right in before the error in the script\n => 38:     binding.pry\n    39:\n    40:     everything_ready.should == true\n\n[1] pry(main)>\n```\n\nWhich means that we have jumped right into the context of our code at the spot where the rocket-arrow is pointing \n(binding.pry). From here, we can use Unix-like commands to explore our code inside the REPL prompt.\n\n`ls` will provide a list of Classes, Modules, methods, instance variables, and private variables available in this \ncontext. This is a great command to learn more about what is available to you at this point. Two other helpful \ncommands are `cd` and `help`. You can use `cd` to change the context to inside an object, class or module. And \n`help` provides you with a quick access of commands available to Pry.\n\nBrowsing through these commands will allow you to discover other neat tricks you can do with Pry. You can also \nexecute any Ruby code you want from Pry\'s prompt.\n\nLet\'s take a closer look at the `everything_ready` method:\n\n```ruby\npry(main)> everything_ready\n=> nil\n```\n\nHmm, this method is not returning `true` as we expect in the test.\n\nLet\'s see if Pry can `help` us. One such command available from Pry is `show-method`, which will print out the \ncode of the method you pass it. Let\'s do that:\n\n```ruby\npry(main)> show-method everything_ready\n\nFrom: pry_test.rb @ line 21:\nOwner: FeatureItems\nVisibility: public\nNumber of lines: 6\n\ndef everything_ready\n  super\n  if @driver.find_element(:css => "#modal_dialog").displayed?\n    @driver.find_element(:css => "#modal_dialog_close").click\n  end\nend\n```\n\nOh, look! I was expecting the #everything_ready method from SiteCheckers, but according to the Owner field from \nPry\'s output, we are overriding the method inside the `FeatureItems` module in order to add some extra functionality \n(presumably, closing a modal if it is shown on the page).\n\nThe reason the method is not returning true is because the last line, which is what will be returned, does not \nresult in true. Instead, when an `if..end` statement is executed, it always returns a nil. We can test this in Pry:\n\n```ruby\npry(main)> if true\npry(main)*   puts "yay"\npry(main)* end\nyay\n=> nil\npry(main)> if false\npry(main)*   puts "boo"\npry(main)* end\n=> nil\n```\n\nThe rocket-arrows after the command we executed indicate the result of the command, which is nil. So, I need to \nupdate the overridden #everything_ready method to return the result of `super` instead of the `if..end` statement.\n\nWhat\'s really cool is that I can do so right inside of Pry using the `edit` command! Typing `edit everything_ready` \nwill pop me inside the FeatureItems#everything_ready method using my favorite terminal editor. Here, I can make the \nupdates to my code:\n\n```ruby\ndef everything_ready\n  result = super\n  if @driver.find_element(:css => "#modal_dialog").displayed?\n    @driver.find_element(:css => "#modal_dialog_close").click\n  end\n  result\nend\n```\n\nNow I save and quit the editor. Once I am back in the Pry prompt, it reloads the file I edited and allows me to \ntry my code again.\n\n```ruby\nFrame number: 0/1\n\nFrom: /home/bgoad/es-pry/pry_test.rb @ line 38 :\n\n    33:     include FeatureItems\n    34:\n    35:     @driver.get("http://www.mysite.com/some-feature")\n    36:\n    37:     # We\'ll jump right in before the error in the script\n => 38:     binding.pry\n    39:\n    40:     everything_ready.should == true\n\npry(main)> everything_ready.should == true\n=> true\n```\n\nTo exit out of Pry and let my test finish running, I simply type `exit`. And now both tests succeed! Don\'t forget \nto remove the `binding.pry` line from inside the test, or else Pry will start right back up again inside the code.\n\n## Summary\n\nNice! I was able to use Pry to jump into my code right before a failure in my test, have a look around in the \nenvironment, debug why my code was failing, and make a quick fix. And I was finally able to verify that my fix was \nworking by running the command in my test again. Pry is pretty darn sweet!\n\nThere are plenty of other uses for pry, this tip just scratches the surface. In fact, \n[the Pry community](https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki/Available-plugins) includes several useful plugins to enhance \nyour Pry experience. Some of the most popular ones include pry-rescue (deposits you into Pry at the point and context \nof a failure or error in your code), pry-stack_explorer (enables you to travel up and down the stack), and pry-debug \n(includes actual debugger functionality like step and continue).\n\nI encourage you to [take a look around the community](http://pryrepl.org) and see \n[how Pry can make your construction and debugging of tests](https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki) so much more efficient. And not only that, \nyou\'ll also begin to learn why your code works in certain ways and how it is structured.

This is great for simple tasks, but its starts to falter when debugging\nmore complex scripts.\n\nOften times you will find yourself puzzling over an error or failure occurring in the middle of your script. It is\nnot very efficient to have to run through each command in your script, line by line, to get to the context of the\nplace you are attempting to debug in a simple REPL. Usually, you have already setup some framework, boilerplate,\nand helper code to assist you in writing your script. This just adds on to the problem, as you have no easy way to\nview the objects or methods available to you while debugging in your script.\n\nSometimes you just need to be able to _pry_ into the code, jump in, open it up and explore the area in order to\nsolve the error you are experiencing.\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n"},6863:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="## Example 1\n\nFirst let's require our libraries (`selenium-webdriver` to drive the browser, `rspec/expectations` & `RSpec::Matchers` for our assertions, and `rest-client` for our HTTP requests) and wire up some simple `setup`, `teardown`, and `run` methods.\n\n```ruby\n# filename: secure_download.rb\n\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rspec/expectations'\nrequire 'rest-client'\ninclude RSpec::Matchers\n\ndef setup\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n```\n\nNext we'll write our test. In it, we'll want to access a page of download links that is behind some form of authentication (Basic HTTP Authentication in this case).\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/download_secure'\n  cookie = @driver.manage.cookie_named 'rack.session'\n  link = @driver.find_element(css: '.example a').attribute('href')\n  response = RestClient.head link, cookie: { cookie[:name] => cookie[:value] }\n  expect(response.headers[:content_type]).to eql('application/octet-stream')\n  expect(response.headers[:content_length].to_i).to be > 0\nend\n```\n\nOnce the page loads, we grab the authentication session cookie from Selenium along with the URL for the first file listed. Then we fire up our HTTP library and perform a `HEAD` request using both the download link and the session cookie. We then check the response headers to make sure the file is the correct type and that it's not empty.\n\nIf we run this script, it will pass. But, it's only limited to the first download link, and it assumes that the file will always be whatever we declared (in this case 'application/octet-stream').\n\nIn the next example, let's update the script to remedy these issues.\n\n## Example 2\n\nHere, we will update our previous example code to make the script more robust, by adding a helper method just before our test code.\n\n```ruby\ndef content_type(file)\n  file = File.basename(file)\n  if file.include? '.txt'\n    'application/octet-stream'\n  elsif file.include? '.pdf'\n    'application/pdf'\n  else\n    raise 'Unknown file type'\n  end\nend\n```\n\nWith this new helper method added, we can tease out the filename from a given URL and return the correct content type. If the file type isn't recognized, then we'll stop the test and raise an exception.\n\nNow we can update our test code to use this method in addition to grabbing all download links from the page and iterating through them.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/download_secure'\n  cookie = @driver.manage.cookie_named 'rack.session'\n  links = @driver.find_elements(css: '.example a')\n  links.map! { |link| link.attribute('href') }\n  links.each do |link|\n    response = RestClient.head link, cookie: { cookie[:name] => cookie[:value] }\n    expect(response.headers[:content_type]).to eql(content_type(link))\n    expect(response.headers[:content_length].to_i).to be > 0\n  end\nend\n```\n\nBy using `find_elements` (plural) we get _all_ download links (returned in an array). We then use `map!` to update the array of download links to give us _just_ the URLs (instead of a collection of Selenium objects which contain URLs). After that, we're able to iterate over the array of URLs, performing a `HEAD` request and assertions for each one (but this time, we're using our new `content_type` helper method).\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nIf we save this file and run it (e.g., `ruby secure_download.rb` from the command-line), here is what will happen.\n\n+ Browser opens\n+ The secure file downloads page loads\n+ The authenticated cookie information is retrieved\n+ All download URLs on the page are found\n+ HTTP library performs a HEAD request against the download link using the retrieved cookie information\n+ The response headers are checked to make sure the file is the correct type and not empty\n+ The previous two steps are repeated until all download links are verified\n+ Browser closes\n\n## Summary\n\nFrom here, it's simple enough to add in additional content types and file types.

It\'s checking to see if the test failed, if it has then it will take a screenshot. Right now the method we\'re referencing isn\'t declared. Let\'s add it now.\n\n```csharp\n// filename: Screenshot.cs\n// ...\n    private void TakeScreenshot()\n    {\n        string SaveLocation = @"C:\\Temp\\" +\n                               "failshot_" +\n                               TestContext.CurrentContext.Test.FullName +\n                               ".png";\n        ITakesScreenshot ScreenshotDriver = (ITakesScreenshot) Driver;\n        ScreenshotDriver.GetScreenshot().SaveAsFile(SaveLocation, ScreenshotImageFormat.Png);\n    }\n// ...\n```\n\nThere are numerous ways to make the filename unique for the screenshot (e.g., unique ID, timestamp, etc.). The simplest way to get started is with the full test name (e.g., test class name and test method name), which we\'ve done. We also specified the save location on disk using a string literal (e.g., `@"C:\\Temp"`), feel free to change it to suit your needs.\n\nThe rest is a simple matter of casting the `Driver` as an `ITakeScreenshot` object and calling `GetScreenshot().SaveAsFile` (specifying the save location and image format -- which is PNG in this case).\n\nNow let\'s wire up our test with a forced failure.\n\n```csharp\n// filename: Screenshot.cs\n// ...\n    [Test]\n    public void ScreenShotOnFailure()\n    {\n        Driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com");\n        Assert.That(false.Equals(true));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen you save this file and run it (`nunit3-console.exe .\\Screenshot.sln` from the command-line) here is what will happen:\n\n- Open the browser\n- Visit the page\n- Test Fails\n- Selenium Captures a screenshot in `C:\\Temp` with the name `failshot_Screenshot.ScreenShotOnFailure.png`\n- Close the browser\n\n## Summary\n\nHaving a screenshot to aid in troubleshooting failing tests along with a stack trace helps in having more insight.\n\nHappy Testing!'},54747:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="## Example\n\nLet's start by importing our requisite classes (for annotations (e.g., `org.junit.After`, etc.), driving the browser with Selenium (e.g., `org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver`, etc.), and matchers for our assertions (e.g., `org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers`, etc.)) and start our class with a setup method.\n\n```java\n// filename: Screenshot.java\nimport org.junit.Before;\nimport org.junit.Rule;\nimport org.junit.Test;\nimport org.junit.rules.TestRule;\nimport org.junit.rules.TestWatcher;\nimport org.junit.runner.Description;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.OutputType;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.TakesScreenshot;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver;\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;\nimport static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.*;\nimport static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;\n\npublic class Screenshot {\n    WebDriver driver;\n\n    @Before\n    public void setUp() throws Exception {\n        driver = new FirefoxDriver();\n    }\n// ...\n```\n\nWe still need to handle our teardown. But in order to get the timing right with screenshots on failure we'll need to break from the norm of a simple `@After` annotation. For this we'll look to a [JUnit Rule](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Rules), specifically the [TestWatcher](http://junit.org/apidocs/org/junit/rules/TestWatcher.html).\n\n```java\n// filename: Screenshot.java\n// ...\n    @Rule\n    public TestRule watcher = new TestWatcher() {\n        @Override\n        protected void failed(Throwable throwable, Description description) {\n            File scrFile = ((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);\n            try {\n                FileUtils.copyFile(scrFile,\n                        new File(\"failshot_\"\n                                + description.getClassName()\n                                + \"_\" + description.getMethodName()\n                                + \".png\"));\n            } catch (IOException exception) {\n                exception.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        protected void finished(Description description) {\n            driver.quit();\n        }\n    };\n// ...\n```\n\nWith a `TestWatcher` we easily gain access to a test after it's failed (e.g., in the `failed` method) and when the test completes regardless of it's outcome (e.g., the `finished` method). So for our teardown we issue `driver.quit();` in `finished`. And when there's a failure we capture a screenshot and write it to disk (in the current working directory) in `failed`.\n\nThere are numerous ways to make the filename unique (e.g., unique ID, timestamp, etc.).

This is\nsomething that is fairly quick to add to your tests, and allows you to review these error messages.\n\nHere is an example.\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},\n    {label: 'C#', value: 'csharp'},\n    {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},\n    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript'},\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals.

With it, you will be able to watch and manipulate network traffic to and from the application you're testing. Thus giving you access to a whole host of functionality that isn't available otherwise.\n\nLet's step through an example using [BrowserMob Proxy](http://bmp.lightbody.net/).\n\n## Example\n\nFirst we need to download a copy of [BrowserMob Proxy](http://bmp.lightbody.net/).\n\nNext we'll create a script and pull in our requisite libraries (e.g., `selenium-webdriver` to drive the browser, `rspec/expectations` and it's matchers for our assertion, and the [`browsermob/proxy`](https://github.com/jarib/browsermob-proxy-rb) library to control the proxy server).\n\n```ruby\n# filename: status_codes.rb\n\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rspec/expectations'\ninclude RSpec::Matchers\nrequire 'browsermob/proxy'\n```\n\nNow let's create a method to prepare the proxy for use with Selenium. In it, we start the proxy server, configure a browser profile to use it (for Firefox in this case), and return the profile object.\n\n```ruby\ndef configure_proxy\n  server = BrowserMob::Proxy::Server.new(\n    File.join(Dir.pwd, 'browsermob-proxy-2.0.0/bin/browsermob-proxy'))\n  @proxy = server.start.create_proxy\n  profile = Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox::Profile.new\n  profile.proxy = @proxy.selenium_proxy\n  profile\nend\n```\n\nNext we wire up some simple `setup`, `teardown`, and `run` methods to handle our test configuration.\n\n```ruby\ndef setup\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox, profile: configure_proxy\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\n  @proxy.close\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n```\n\nIn `setup` we use the `configure_proxy` method when specifying the profile object. And we close the proxy in `teardown` (after quitting the Selenium session).\n\nNow let's create a helper method to pull the status code out of the browser's [HTTP Archive](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/) (a.k.a. HAR) when an action is performed on the page.\n\n```ruby\ndef retrieve_status_code\n  @proxy.new_har\n  yield\n  @proxy.har.entries.first.response.status\nend\n```\n\nNow we're ready to wire up our test.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  status_code = retrieve_status_code do\n    @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/status_codes/404'\n  end\n\n  expect(status_code).to eql 404\nend\n```\n\nWhen visiting the page we are passing the Selenium command to the `retrieve_status_code` method which returns the HTTP response code. We store this in a `status_code` variable and use it to check that the response code is what we expect (`404`).\n\n**NOTE:** If you get an error when running your test, be sure to append `log: true` when creating an instance of `Browsermob::Proxy::Server`.\n\n```ruby\n  server = BrowserMob::Proxy::Server.new(\n    File.join(Dir.pwd, 'browsermob-proxy-2.0.0/bin/browsermob-proxy'), log: true)\n```\n\nNow when you run your test, you will see more detailed information as to why the server was unable to start.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nIf you save this file and run it (e.g., `ruby status_codes.rb` from the command-line) here is what will happen:\n\n+ Proxy server starts\n+ Proxy server session created\n+ Browser opens\n+ Visit the URL\n+ Retrieve the HTTP Status Code from loading the page\n+ Check that the status code is what was expected\n+ Browser closes\n+ Proxy session closes\n\n## Summary\n\nThis tip was inspired by [Jim Evans'](https://twitter.com/jimevansmusic) multi-part blog post series on doing the same thing in C# with Fiddler ([1](http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2013/08/implementing-webdriver-http-status.html), [2](http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2013/08/implementing-http-status-codes-in.html), [3](http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2013/08/implementing-http-status-codes-in_17.html)) which was in response to [Selenium Issue 141](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=141).

The best\nway to do this is to answer these four questions:\n\n1. How does your business make money?\n2. How do your users use your application?\n3. What browsers are your users using?\n4. What things have broken in the application before?\n\n__NOTE: for organizations that don't deal *directly* in dollars and cents (e.g. non-profits, federal agencies,\netc.) you should focus on how the application generates value for the end user.__\n\nAfter answering these questions you'll have a better understanding of the critical functionality and relevant\nbrowsers for the application you're testing. This will help you focus your test automation efforts on the things\nthat matter most.\n\nYou'll want to keep track of these items somehow -- the recommended approach is to use a prioritized backlog.\n\n## What To Do With The Answers\n\n### Question 1 - Money/Value\n\nEvery company's application makes money (or generates value) through a core set of functionality -- a.k.a. a\n'funnel'. Your answers to this question will help you determine what functionality makes up the funnel. This will\nbe your highest priority for test automation.\n\n### Question 2 - Usage Data\n\nThere can be a big difference between how you think your application is used  and how your users actually use it.\nOdds are your application offers a robust set of functionality that grows well beyond the core functionality of\nthe funnel.\n\nYour answers to this question will help you determine what features are highly used and lightly used. Add the\nhighly used items onto your automation backlog based on order of use below the answers to question 1.\n\n### Question 3 - Browsers\n\nNow that you know what functionality is business critical and widely adopted by your users, you need to determine\nwhat browsers to focus your automated web testing efforts on. Your usage data will tell you this as well. It will\nhelp you determine which browsers you can reasonably avoid testing in (e.g. based on non-existent or low usage numbers).\n\nNote the top 2 browsers (or 3 depending on your numbers), but focus on the top 1 for now. This is the browser you\nwill start writing your automated tests in.\n\n### Question 4 - Risky Bits\n\nTo round out the strategy it is best to think about what things have broken in the application before. You might be\nable to glean some of this information from a defect tracker but the best information is often in the minds of your\ncolleagues. Ask around and see what they say.\n\nWhat you come up with will likely read like a laundry list of browser specific issues or functionality that has been\nflaky or forgotten about in the past. Be sure to check this list against your automation backlog. If you've come\nacross something that's not already in the backlog, add it and put it at the bottom. If it is there, make a note\nin the backlog item that this has been an issue in the past. If the issue has happened numerous times and has the\npotential to occur again, move the item up in the backlog priority.\n\nIf issues keep cropping up that are related to a specific browser, compare this browser to your short list from\nquestion #3. If it's a browser that's not in your list, but it's a small pocket of high value users, track it on\nthe backlog but put it at the bottom.\n\n## Now You Are Ready\n\nHaving answered these questions you should now have a prioritized backlog of critical functionality that's backed\nup by usage data, a short list of browsers to focus on, and an understanding of the risky parts of your application.\nWith it, you can make sure you are on the right track with your test automation (regardless if you're just getting\nstarted with test automation or already have a mature test automation practice).\n\n## Summary\n\nHopefully this strategy will help you focus your testing efforts, avoid wasting time, and increase your confidence\nin the approach you are taking.\n\nThis strategy works best for applications with existing functionality and does not speak directly to testing new\nfunctionality that's being actively developed. That's not to say that the two could not co-exist. It largely depends\non your available resources and pace of development but in order to reach high quality at speed, you first have\nto go slow.\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals.

In this case, a CSV (comma-separated value) file called `user_data.csv`, like so:\n\n```text\naccount_type,username,password,notification_message\nbad_password,tomsmith,badPassword,Your password is invalid!\nbad_username,badUsername,SuperSecretPassword!,Your username is invalid!\nstandard_user,tomsmith,SuperSecretPassword!,You logged into a secure area!\n```\n\nNext let's create our test file, require our requisite libraries (e.g., `selenium-webdriver` to control the browser, `rspec/expectations` & `RSpec::Matchers` for our assertion, and `csv` to import the data from our CSV file) and add some simple `setup`, `teardown`, and `run` methods.\n\n```ruby\n# filename: data_driven.rb\n\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rspec/expectations'\nrequire 'csv'\ninclude RSpec::Matchers\n\ndef setup\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n```\n\nNow let's wire up our CSV parsing.\n\n```ruby\ndef user_data\n  user_data = CSV.read Dir.pwd + '/user_data.csv'\n  descriptor = user_data.shift\n  descriptor = descriptor.map { |key| key.to_sym }\n  user_data.map { |user| Hash[ descriptor.zip(user) ] }\nend\n```\n\nIn `user_data` we read the CSV file in and grab the first row in it with `.shift`. We store this row in a variable called `descriptor` and convert each value into a symbol. We then iterate over the rest of the CSV data and create a Hash object for each row of user data. In each Hash we are binding the relevant descriptor to each piece of user data (through the use of `.zip`). This enables us to reference each of the user values by looking them up in the Hash by their descriptor symbol.\n\nNext we'll need a helper method that will responsibly obtain the notification text from the page. It will need to both wait for the text to appear and clean up the resulting text, so it doesn't include any extraneous characters.\n\n```ruby\ndef notification_text\n  wait = Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(timeout: 5)\n  wait.until { @driver.find_element(class: 'flash').displayed? }\n  @driver.find_element(class: 'flash').text.delete('^a-zA-z !.')\nend\n```\n\nWe use the stock Selenium Wait function (e.g., an explicit wait) to continuously perform an action until either the timeout is reached or the action is true (whichever comes first). We then use it to see if the notification text is displayed on the page. If it is, then we grab the text and clean it up with a regular expression that deletes non-letter characters while preserving `!` and `.` (which are expected in the output we're testing for).\n\nNow we're ready to wire up our test. In it, we will iterate through each of the user entries in the CSV file and use their data to both complete a login action and verify the notification message.\n\n```ruby\nuser_data.each do |user|\n  run do\n    @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login'\n    @driver.find_element(id: 'username').send_keys user[:username]\n    @driver.find_element(id: 'password').send_keys user[:password]\n    @driver.find_element(id: 'login').submit\n    begin\n      expect(notification_text).to eql user[:notification_message]\n    rescue Exception => error\n      puts error.message\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nWe wrap the notification message assertion in a `rescue` block so that when an exception occurs the test will continue on with the next piece of user data after outputting the failure message to the command prompt.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nIf you save this file and run it (e.g., `ruby data_driven.rb` from the command-line) the script will parse the CSV file and perform the following for each entry:\n\n+ Open the browser\n+ Load the login page\n+ Submit the login form with user data\n+ Grab the notification message and assert it against the expected value\n+ Close the browser\n\n## Summary\n\nBy storing data in a central repository to use for your tests and using Data-driven testing, you can simplify running repeated tests with various outputs.\n\nHappy Testing!\n"},17657:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'Data Driven Testing'\nid: '19-data-driven-testing'\nslug: /19-data-driven-testing\nsidebar_label: Data Driven Testing\ndescription: \"There are times when you run across functionality you want to test repeatedly with various inputs to see how the system behaves.

We're going to go over a way to do this that will take some of the burden out of the process.\n\nSometimes performing these tests are because you want to test the expected outcomes. Other times, because you\nwant to see if the system breaks in an odd way. But, wiring up all these permutations into a set of automated\ntests can be burdensome and rife with copied code, which can make it hard to maintain over time.\n\n## A Solution\n\nEnter Data-driven Testing.\n\nBy storing your desired inputs and expected outcomes in a central repository of some kind (e.g. a comma separated\nfile, database, etc.) you can easily wire up tests to use each of them instead of writing numerous tests and\nhard-coding these values directly in your test code.\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals.

This is where the\nmagic is happening in this example. In it, we\'re creating a uniquely named temp directory\n(e.g., `System.Guid.NewGuid().ToString();`), configuring a browser options object (for Firefox in this case), and\nplying it with the necessary configuration parameters to make it automatically download the file where we want\n(e.g., in the newly created temp directory).\n\nHere\'s a breakdown of each of the browser preferences being set:\n\n- `browser.download.dir` accepts a string. This is how we set the custom download path. It needs to be an absolute path.\n- `browser.download.folderList` takes a number. It tells Firefox which download directory to use. `2` tells it to use\na custom download path, whereas `1` would use the browser\'s default path, and `0` would place them on the Desktop.\n- `browser.helperApps.neverAsk.saveToDisk` tells Firefox when not to prompt for a file download. It accepts a string\nof [the file\'s MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type). If you want to specify more than one, you do it with a comma-separated string (which\nwe\'ve done).\n- `pdfjs.disabled` is for when downloading PDFs. This overrides the sensible default in Firefox that previews PDFs in\nthe browser. It accepts a boolean.\n\nThe options are then passed into our instance of Selenium (e.g., `_driver = new FirefoxDriver(Options);`).\n\nAfter our test executes, the `TearDown()` method will run thanks to the `[TestCleanup]` attribute. This\ncalls `_driver?.Quit();` which will close the browser instance. Then, it will clean up the temp directory by deleting\nit. Specifying `true` as a second parameter for `Directory.Delete()` will recursively delete the files in the folder\nbefore deleting it.\n\n### The Test\n\nLines 38 to 56 are the test itself.\n\nWe create an `DownloadFileToDisk()` method and add a `[TestMethod]` attribute, so it is run as a test.

We need to wait for the download to finish, so we leverage the `WebDriverWait` class to wait for\nthe file to exist in the directory. After the file downloads, we perform some rudimentary checks to make sure the\nunique temp directory isn\'t empty and then check the file (or files) to see that they aren\'t empty either.\n\n### Executing the Test\n\nBefore executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the project file (e.g.,\n`csharp.csproj` in this case).\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>csharp.csproj</code> file.</summary>\n    <div>\n        <TipCode codePath={"2-download-a-file/code/csharp/csharp.csproj"} language={"xml"}/>\n    </div>\n</details>\n\nFinally, we can run the test by executing `dotnet test` from the command-line.'},69356:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='import TipCode from "@site/src/components/tipCode";\n\n## TL;DR - Show Me The Code\n\n<TipCode codePath={"2-download-a-file/code/java/src/test/java/com/elemental/selenium/DownloadTest.java"}\n         language={"java"}/>\n\n## Code Walkthrough\n\n### Importing Libraries\n\nLines 3 to 14 are pulling in our requisite classes for annotations (e.g., `org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach`, etc.),\ndriving the browser with Selenium (e.g., `org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver`, etc.), matchers for assertions\n(e.g., `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;`, etc. ), something to handle local files (e.g., `java.io.File`), and a means\nto create a uniquely named folder to place downloaded files in (e.g., `java.util.UUID`)\n\n### Setup and Teardown\n\nLines 21 to 42 are setting up and tearing down the browser instance.

After that, we perform some rudimentary checks to make sure the directory\nisn't empty and that the file isn't empty either.\n\n### Executing the Test\n\nBefore executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `Gemfile` file.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>Gemfile</code> file.</summary>\n    <div>\n        <TipCode codePath={\"2-download-a-file/code/ruby/Gemfile\"} language={\"txt\"}/>\n    </div>\n</details>\n\n\nFinally, we can run the test by executing `ruby download.rb` from the command-line."},31691:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='import TipCode from "@site/src/components/tipCode";\n\n## TL;DR - Show Me The Code\n\n<TipCode codePath={"2-download-a-file/code/selenide/src/test/java/com/elemental/selenium/DownloadTest.java"}\n         language={"java"}/>\n\n## Code Walkthrough\n\n### Importing Libraries\n\nFirst, we pull in our requisite classes:\n  * test runner (e.g., `org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach`, etc.),\n  * opening the browser with Selenide (e.g., `com.codeborne.selenide.Selenide.open`),\n  * matchers for assertions (e.g., `org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat`)\n\nNB! You don\'t need to add the typical "selenium*" dependencies.\nJust one dependency is enough: `com.codeborne:selenide`.\nIt will pull down all the needed Selenium dependencies automatically.\n\n### Setup and Teardown\n\nNext, we are setting up the browser instance. The `openAUT` opens the application under test before\neach test.\n\n### The Test\n\nOur `downloadFile` test, after visiting the page, we find the download link and call method `download` for it.\nThis method does its magic and returns the downloaded file. Now you can verify its name or content.\n\nNB! You don\'t need to find the downloaded file in any directories. Method `$.download()` _returns_ the file. It\'s\nalready available for you, so you can verify it right away.\n\n### More About Downloading Files in Selenide\n\nSelenide sample for downloading files is straightforward because Selenide does all the work for you:\n* creates a uniquely named temp directory\n* configures the browser to make it automatically download files to that unique directory\n* clicks a web element\n* waits until the file arises in the downloads folder\n\nIn addition, Selenide has more [ways to download files](https://selenide.org/javadoc/current/com/codeborne/selenide/FileDownloadMode.html):\n  * `HTTPGET` (default one)\n  * `FOLDER`\n  * `CDP`\n  * `PROXY`\n\nLearn more about downloading files in Selenide from Andrei Solntsev\'s\n[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwHG550moGc)\nand [blog post](https://selenide.org/2019/12/10/advent-calendar-download-files/).\n\n### Executing the Test\n\nBefore executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `pom.xml` file.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>pom.xml</code> file.</summary>\n    <div>\n        <TipCode codePath={"2-download-a-file/code/selenide/pom.xml"} language={"xml"}/>\n    </div>\n</details>\n\nFinally, we can run the test by executing `mvn test` from the command-line.\n'},28544:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='using System;\nusing

files](/tips/1-upload-a-file) we hit the same issue with downloading\nthem -- a dialog box just out of reach of your automation script. With some additional configuration, we can side-step\nthe dialog box.\n\n## A Solution\n\nIn order to avoid the dialog box, we will be instructing the browser to download files to a specific location without\nbeing prompted. After the file is downloaded we can then perform some simple checks to make sure the file is what we\nexpect.\n\nLet\'s continue with an example.\n\n## Example\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from \'@site/src/components/displayTips\';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: \'Python\', value: \'python\'},\n    {label: \'C#\', value: \'csharp\'},\n    {label: \'Java\', value: \'java\'},\n    {label: \'JavaScript\', value: \'javascript\'},\n    {label: \'Ruby\', value: \'ruby\'},\n    {label: \'Selenide\', value: \'selenide\'},\n]}/>\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nAfter executing the test, this is what will happen:\n\n+ Create a uniquely named temp directory in the present working directory\n+ Open the browser\n+ Visit the page\n+ Find and click the first download link on the page\n+ Automatically download the file to the temp directory without prompting\n+ Check that the temp directory is not empty\n+ Check that the downloaded file is not empty\n+ Close the browser\n+ Delete the temp directory\n\n## Outro\n\nA similar approach can be applied to some other browsers with varying configurations. But downloading files this\nway is not sustainable or recommended. Mark Collin articulates this point well in his prominent\n[write-up about it](https://ardesco.lazerycode.com/index.php/2012/07/how-to-download-files-with-selenium-and-why-you-shouldnt/).\nIn a future tip we will cover a more reliable, faster, and scalable browser-agnostic approach to downloading files.\nStay tuned.\n\nHappy Testing!\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nimport DefaultAvatar from "@site/src/components/defaultAvatar";\n\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Mike Millgate"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/trabulmonkee.png"}\n    description={"Contributed the Python code for this tip."}\n    url={"https://github.com/trabulmonkee"}\n/>\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Isaul Vargas"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/isaulv.png"}\n    description={"Python code review"}\n    url={"https://github.com/isaulv"}\n/>\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Peter Bittner"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/bittner.png"}\n    description={"Python code review"}\n    url={"https://github.com/bittner"}\n/>\n\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Jonathan Taylor"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/jtay2380.png"}\n    description={"Contributed the initial C# code for this tip."}\n    url={"https://github.com/jtay2380"}\n/>\n\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Roman Isko"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/sturman.png"}\n    description={"Contributed the initial Java code for this tip."}\n    url={"https://github.com/sturman"}\n/>\n\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Andrei Solntsev"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/asolntsev.png"}\n    description={"Contributed the Selenide code for this tip."}\n    url={"https://github.com/asolntsev"}\n/>\n\n## Authors\n\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Dave Piacente"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/tourdedave.png"}\n    description={"Original creator of Elemental Selenium"}\n    url={"https://github.com/tourdedave"}\n    author={true}\n/>\n\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Diego Molina"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/diemol.png"}\n    description={"Current maintainer of Elemental Selenium"}\n    url={"https://github.com/diemol"}\n    author={true}\n/>\n\n'},93002:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'How To Pick a Programming Language'\nid: '21-choosing-a-language'\nslug: /21-choosing-a-language\ndescription: \"In order to work well with Selenium you need to choose a programming language to write your acceptance tests in. This guide will help you determine which language to choose for testing.\"\nnumber: 21\nhide_table_of_contents: true\nlevel: 1\npublish_date: 2015-10-13\ntags:\n  - 'programming language'\n  - 'frameworks'\ncategory:\n  - 'resources'\n---\n\n# How to Pick a Programming Language\n\n## Intro\n\nIn order to work well with Selenium you need to choose a programming language to write your acceptance tests in.\nThis guide will help you determine which language to choose for testing.\n\nIt might seem like a good idea to choose the same language that the application you're testing is written in,\nbecause if you get stuck you can ask the developers on your team for help.\n\nBut if you're not proficient in this language (or new to software development), then your progress will be slow,\nand you'll likely end up asking for more developer help than they have time for which could hinder your automation\nefforts and slow your testing progress.\n\n## A Solution\n\nA great way to determine which language to go with is to answer one simple question: __Who will own the automated\ntests?__\n\nThe answer to this, and the discussion that unfolds from it, will help you more effectively choose a programming\nlanguage for test automation.\n\n## Example\n\nIf you're a tester (or a team of testers) and you will be building and maintaining the test automation, then it's\nbest to consider what languages you (and your team) already have experience with, or are interested in gaining,\nrather than what the application you're testing is built in. Have a discussion with your team to see what interests\nthem.\n\nFor example, there's not much advantage in writing your test automation in Java if your team has no previous\ndevelopment experience and will be the ones owning it. Instead, try to choose a language that is more approachable\n-- e.g. a scripting language like Ruby or Python. But if you're a developer that is working on the application and\njust looking to add automated acceptance testing to the mix then it makes sense to continue with the same language.\n\nAs your suite of tests grow you will find the need to add functionality to make things easier to use, run faster,\noffer better reporting, etc. When this happens you will effectively be doing two jobs -- building a test harness\n(a.k.a. a Selenium framework) AND writing automated tests.\n\nAs you're considering which language to go with, consider what open source frameworks already exist for the languages\nyou're considering. Going with one that's already built will save you a lot of time and give you a host of\nfunctionality out of the box that you would otherwise have to build and maintain yourself -- and it's FREE.\n\n## Summary\n\nChoosing a programming language for automated testing is not a decision that should be taken lightly. If you're just\nstarting out (or looking to port your tests) then considering and discussing this will help position you for\ngreater success.\n\nFor a second and third opinion on this topic you can read Adam Goucher and Joe Colantonio's takes [here](https://saucelabs.com/resources/blog/stop-being-a-language-snob-debunking-the-but-our-application-is-written-in-x-myth-guest-post)\nand [here](http://www.joecolantonio.com/2015/05/31/selenium-what-programming-language-you-should-learn-to-get-into-test-automation/).\n\nHappy Testing!\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals. He also created and maintains the-internet (an open-source web app that's\nperfect for writing automated tests against).\n\nDave has helped numerous companies successfully implement automated acceptance testing; including The Motley Fool,\nManTech International, Sittercity, and Animoto. He is also an active member of the Selenium project and has spoken\nat numerous conferences and meetups around the world about automated acceptance testing.\n\n![Dave Haeffner profile picture](/img/authors/dave-haeffner.jpeg#author-img 'a title')"},7485:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="## Example 1\n\nWith the markup below (taken from [here](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/download)) we can demonstrate grabbing the first link from a series of links with varying degrees of precision via CSS Selectors.\n\n```html\n<div id=\"content\" class=\"large-12 columns\">\n  <div class=\"example\">\n    <h3>File Downloader</h3>\n    <a href=\"download/hello-world.pdf\">hello-world.pdf</a><br>\n    <a href=\"download/avatar.jpg\">avatar.jpg</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nTo begin the script, here are the setup, teardown, and run actions we will use.\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\n\ndef setup\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n```\n\nThe way Selenium works is by first finding the element you want and then chaining additional actions to it. So, to grab the first link and output it's URL we can do the following.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/download'\n  link = @driver.find_element(css: 'a').attribute('href')\n  puts link\nend\n```\n\nNote the `css: a`. The `css:` is us telling Selenium what locator strategy to use, and the `a` is a selector for a link.\n\n## Example 2\n\nWhile the previous solution works, it's far from perfect. Of all the possible links on the page Selenium will return the first one. So, if there were other links aside from the ones listed in the download list, we may not get the result we want. To help this, we can be more precise with our CSS.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/download'\n  link = @driver.find_element(css: '#content a').attribute('href')\n  puts link\nend\n```\nNote the `css: '#content a'`. The `#content` is a selector for an HTML element with `id=\"content\"`. With it, we are able to chain together the previously used `a` (separated by spaces) to grab the first link from within the content div on the page.\n\n## Example 3\n\nWhile Example 2 does become more precise, we can scope down even further.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/download'\n  link = @driver.find_element(css: '#content .example a').attribute('href')\n  puts link\nend\n```\n\nNote the `css: '#content .example a'`. The `.example` is a selector for an HTML element with `class=\"example\"`. With this we are able to grab the first link from within the example div which is within the content div.\n\nAlternatively, we could have just scoped into `.example a`. Either would have worked and for this simple example it doesn't matter. The layout of a page will ultimately influence your CSS Selector decision. The ultimate goal is to find and use unique and reliable selectors that will get you the intended behavior you want for your test.\n\nYou can find a full list of CSS Selectors [here](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp).\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n<u>Example 1</u>\n\n+ Open the browser\n+ Visit the page\n+ Grab the first link and output the URL to terminal\n\n<u>Example 1</u>\n\n+ Open the browser\n+ Visit the page\n+ Grab the first link within the content div on the page and output the URL to terminal\n\n<u>Example 1</u>\n\n+ Open the browser\n+ Visit the page\n+ Grab the first link from within the example div, which is within the content div, and output the URL to terminal\n\n\n## Summary\n\nIn a perfect world all pages would be written with sound markup and uniquely named bits but that's more the exception than the rule. So, you will likely find as you dig into automating various sites that things will not be as straightforward as the examples above. There are some circumstances where you have a selector dialed in, but you hit issues with older browsers.\n\nAs far as finding CSS Selectors, the simplest way to find them is to inspect the elements on a page. The best way to do this is from within your web browser. Fortunately popular browsers of today come pre-loaded with development tools that make this simple to accomplish.\n\nWhen viewing the page, right click on the element you want to interact with and click __Inspect Element__. This will bring up a small window with all the HTML for the page but zoomed into your selection highlighted. From here you can see if there are unique attributes you can work with (e.g. `id`, `class`, etc.). At the bottom of the window a set of selectors will be listed showing you the selector for your selection and a hierarchy of the selectors on the page that lead up to your selection.\n\nFrom here you should be able to construct a CSS Selector to use in a test.\n\nTo that end, stay tuned for future tips where we'll cover more advanced CSS Selector techniques and strategies for dealing with older browsers.\n\nUntil then, Happy Testing!"},53303:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'Locator Strategy'\nid: '22-locator-strategy'\nslug: /22-locator-strategy\nsidebar_label: Locator Strategy\ndescription: \"In web design CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to apply styles to the markup (HTML) on a page.

CSS is able to do\nthis by declaring which bits of the markup it wants to interact with through the use of selectors. Selenium\noperates in a similar manner but instead of changing the style of elements it interacts with them by clicking,\ngetting values from, typing, sending keys, etc.\n\nAt the heart of Selenium is the ability to interact with a page through its elements by way of various locator\nstrategies. Identifier, Id, Name, Link, DOM, XPath, and CSS -- oh my!\n\nThis is the life-blood of your automated tests and there are numerous elements to choose from. But which ones do\nyou use? And when do you use them and why?\n\n## A Solution\n\nWhile each locator strategy serves its purpose there is one approach that is better. It is one that is\ncross-browser performant, simpler to maintain, and powerful -- that's CSS Selectors.\n\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals. He also created and maintains the-internet (an open-source web app that's\nperfect for writing automated tests against).\n\nDave has helped numerous companies successfully implement automated acceptance testing; including The Motley Fool,\nManTech International, Sittercity, and Animoto. He is also an active member of the Selenium project and has spoken\nat numerous conferences and meetups around the world about automated acceptance testing.\n\n![Dave Haeffner profile picture](/img/authors/dave-haeffner.jpeg#author-img 'a title')"},17812:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="## Example 1\n\nLet's use from [the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet) which load content dynamically ([link](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading)). On it there is a `Start` button that when clicked will trigger a loading bar to appear for 5 seconds. After that time it will disappear and a new element with the text `'Hello World!'` will appear.\n\nWe'll start by requiring our dependent libraries (`selenium-webriver` to drive the browser and `rspec/expectations` & `RSpec::Matchers` to perform our assertions) and wiring up some `setup`, `teardown`, and `run` methods to handle our test configuration.\n\n```ruby\n# filename: dynamic_loading.rb\n\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rspec/expectations'\ninclude RSpec::Matchers\n\ndef setup\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n```\n\nNow we can create our first test. In it, we'll visit the page, click the start button, wait for the finish text to appear, and assert that it appeared.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/2'\n  @driver.find_element(css: '#start button').click\n  Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(timeout: 6).until { @driver.find_element(id: 'finish').displayed? }\n  expect(@driver.find_element(id: 'finish').displayed?).to eql true\nend\n```\n\nIn the code above we are using an explicit wait with a timeout of `6` seconds (e.g. `Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(timeout: 6).until`), looking for the element with the finish text (e.g., `@driver.find_element(id: 'finish')`, and seeing if it's displayed (e.g., `.displayed?`).\n\nIf we set the timeout too low (e.g. `timeout: 2`) Selenium won't wait long enough for the loading bar to finish, which will trigger the timeout threshold and throw an exception (e.g. `until': timed out after 2 seconds (Selenium::WebDriver::Error::TimeOutError)`).\n\nAnd if we didn't use an explicit wait at all, the test would have errored because Selenium would have tried to check for the finish text before it displayed and return a `NoSuchElement` exception (e.g., `Unable to locate element: {\"method\":\"css selector\",\"selector\":\"#finish\"} (Selenium::WebDriver::Error::NoSuchElementError)`).\n\nFor applications that already have the target element on the page but have it hidden, this approach will work as well (which we can see by pointing our test at the other dynamic loading example).\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/1'\n  @driver.find_element(css: '#start button').click\n  Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(timeout: 6).until { @driver.find_element(id: 'finish').displayed? }\n  expect(@driver.find_element(id: 'finish').displayed?).to eql true\nend\n```\n## Example 2\n\nExplicit waits are a useful tool to have in your toolbelt since they enable you to finely tune your tests and avoid static sleeps and arbitrary timeouts. But rather than litter your test code with the verbose Selenium incantation, it's best to pull this code out into a method that accepts a timeout argument and the action you want to wait for as a block.\n\nYou can then clean up our test code and reuse this method whenever an explicit wait is needed.\n\n```ruby\ndef wait_for(seconds = 6)\n  Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(:timeout => seconds).until { yield }\nend\n\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/1'\n  @driver.find_element(css: '#start button').click\n  wait_for { @driver.find_element(id: 'finish').displayed? }\n  expect(@driver.find_element(id: 'finish').displayed?).to eql true\nend\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen you save the file and run it (e.g., `ruby dynamic_loading.rb` from the command-line) here is what will happen:\n\n+ Open the browser\n+ Visit the page\n+ Click the Start button\n+ Wait for the loading bar to disappear and display the finish text\n+ Assert that the finish text element is displayed\n+ Close the browser\n\n## Summary\n\nHopefully this tip will help you build more efficient and resilient tests when faced with dynamic pages that are constructed in various ways.\n\nHappy Testing!"},36404:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'Dynamic Pages'\nid: '23-dynamic-pages'\nslug: /23-dynamic-pages\nsidebar_label: Dynamic Pages\ndescription: \"Let's say you want to test some functionality of a web application but it loads things dynamically.

With them, you specify a timeout and an action.\nSelenium will repeatedly try that action until it can either complete it successfully (at which point it will move\nonto the next step of the test), or it will throw a timeout exception (causing your test to error).\n\nLet's continue with an example.\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals.

When we make a new user for a test, we have a \"clean slate\" which allows us great control over how to shape that user for our test. We eliminate possible corruption of our test user's state from other tests. And if we make that user using a REST API call, we avoid the time penalty of having to fill out a sign-up form (not to mention having to find any emails involved in confirming an email address).\n\nSuppose our hypothetical website is backed by a REST API, and it documents a call to create a user as follows:\n\n`POST http://api.myfakeapp.com/v1/create-user`\n\nThis call takes a JSON request body, and creates a user.\n\n```javascript\n{\n  'username':   'example-username',\n  'password':   'abcd1234',\n  'email':      'bob@example.com',\n  'first_name': 'bob',\n  'last_name':  'example'\n}\n```\n\nThat tells us we will have to send an `HTTP POST` request to the URL `/v1/create-user`, with a JSON object body that has valid values for all the fields shown. If this all sounds scary, it might help to know that this is more-or-less what your browser does when you submit a form. In this case though, we are going to do it sans-browser.\n\nThe following module has a `create_test_user` method which we will incorporate into our test setups. It contains some helpful inline comments that describe each of the actions being taken.\n\n```ruby\n# filename: rest_api_interface.rb\n\nrequire 'net/http'\nrequire 'json'\nrequire 'securerandom'\n\nmodule RestApiInterface\n\n  Headers = {\n    'content-type' => 'application/json',\n    'user-agent' => 'Rest Api Helper',\n  }\n\n  def post_to_api path, post_body_obj\n    json_body = JSON.generate(post_body_obj)\n    response = nil\n    Net::HTTP.start('api.myfakeapp.com') do |http|\n      response = http.post(path, json_body, Headers)\n    end\n    response\n  end\n\n  def create_test_user\n    # Step 1: Build the user parameters randomly\n    random_test_user = {\n      'username'   => random_string,\n      'password'   => random_string,\n      'email'      => \"#{random_string}@testing.com\",\n      'first_name' => 'test',\n      'last_name'  => 'user',\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Execute the API call\n    response = post_to_api '/v0/oauth/create-profile', random_test_user\n\n    # Step 3: Ensure the api call returned a success code\n    if response.code != '200'\n      raise 'User creation failed'\n    end\n\n    # Final Step: Return the user object so we can use it\n    random_test_user\n  end\n\n  def random_string\n    # This is an easy way to get a good randomized string\n    SecureRandom.hex\n  end\nend\n\n```\n\nWith this we are now ready to make, and then use, test users from within our Selenium code.\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rest_api_interface'\ninclude RestApiInterface\n\ndef setup\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox\n  @user = create_test_user\nend\n\ndef login\n  @driver.get 'http://myfakeapp.com'\n  @driver.find_element(:css, 'input[name=\"username\"]').send_keys @user['username']\n  @driver.find_element(:css, 'input[name=\"password\"]').send_keys @user['password']\n  @driver.find_element(:css, 'button[name=\"login\"]').click\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  login\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n```\n\nWith support code like the above, we are free to write code that can assume we are logged in with a clean user. Like the following (which will output the user that is logged in).\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  puts @driver.find_element(:css, '#user_id').text\nend\n```\n\n## Going beyond signups\n\nThis technique of mixing in REST API calls with your Selenium code is very powerful. Admittedly, the example given is easy to criticize. Signing up a fresh user for every test is probably not an appropriate strategy for many sites. Further, the example does not get around having to login. Once the mechanics of this kind of interaction are in place however, it becomes possible to setup many kind of resources and relationships between them using REST API calls.\n\nI used to work for an organization that ran highly specialized markets, with several configuration options, as well as different kinds of users including buyers and sellers. I used this technique to build test markets through all permutations of configuration with test buyers and sellers. My Selenium tests would then simply visit the test markets as the test buyers and sellers and confirm the expected features were available.This allowed my tests to provide both a high level of coverage while staying fast, precise, and wholly self-contained.\n\n## Testing against REST only\n\nOnce you've gotten used to using REST APIs to create test data fast, there is a question that naturally pops up: \"Why not just test against the REST API itself, without using Selenium?\"\n\nIndeed, there are many great reasons to consider pure REST API tests to supplement a Selenium test suite. When compared to Selenium tests, pure REST API tests are:\n\n* Extremely fast\n* Extremely reliable\n* Easier to build higher levels of test coverage\n* Simpler execution architecture.\n* More encouraging of testable design in the application\n\nREST API tests are very appropriate for exercising the business logic that powers an application. Of course, they leave a lot of important parts of the application untested including Javascript within the website, thus they should never be considered a complete Selenium replacement.\n\n__Note: Given the ever increasing important of mobile applications, I believe special mention concerning the testing of a mobile application is important here. There are several Selenium like tools for mobile testing out there, but the landscape is still quite immature. Fortunately, the majority of most mobile applications are in fact backed by a REST API. Pure REST API testing should be considered an important component of any test plan for every mobile application!__\n\n\n## Summary\n\nWhen considering how to make your Selenium suite have higher coverage, run faster, and be more reliable, it is often worth looking beyond Selenium for solutions to these common problems. REST APIs are becoming very common and provide a relatively easy means for creating test data which Selenium tests can make use of. REST APIs can in fact be a powerful way to test an application all by themselves.\n\n## About The Author\n\nRobert Schultheis is a Test Engineer for [Knewton](http://www.knewton.com/), a company devoted to personalizing education for every student globally.

A bug in some part of the application that is\nunrelated to the test should not cause the test to fail.\n+ **Independent.** A test should not have it's outcome affected by any other test in the test suite.\n+ **Fast.** This doesn't need much explanation. The quicker a test suite runs, the more useful it is.\n\nOf course there are many other properties that might be included in such a list, but I mention these specifically\nbecause they can be particularly challenging to achieve in a Selenium test suite. The reason for this is that Selenium\ntests often involve setups that may include a sign-up, a login, some navigation, form submission, or other\ninteractions with a website. Only after doing those things are you ready to assert on some aspect of the website.\nIf you confine your tests to only being allowed to interact with the website, there is little that can be done to\nalleviate this issue.\n\n## A Solution\n\nREST APIs are increasingly common in the backends of newer websites. If you are fortunate enough to have such an\narchitecture in the site you are testing it may make sense to make use of those REST APIs in your Selenium test suite.\nBy using calls to the REST APIs in the backend to perform parts of a test setup, and using Selenium to perform the\nassertion within the website normally, we can end up with tests that are faster, more focused, and more reliable.\n\nREST APIs are based on the HTTP protocol, which is the same protocol that powers essentially the entire internet.\nNearly every modern programming language has libraries that can be used to make HTTP requests, thus we can add\nsupport for calling into REST APIs to virtually any test suite.\n\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n"},60536:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='## Example 1\n\n**NOTE: You can see the application under test [here](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables). It\'s an example from [the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet). In the example there are 2 tables. We will start with the first table and then work with the second.**\n\nLet\'s start by declaring our requisite classes for our testing framework (e.g., `using NUnit.Framework`), driving the browser with Selenium (e.g., `using OpenQA.Selenium`, etc.), and accessing C#\'s collections functionality (e.g., `using System.Collections.Generic`).\n\n```csharp\n// filename: Tables.cs\nusing NUnit.Framework;\nusing OpenQA.Selenium;\nusing OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox;\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\npublic class Tables\n{\n    IWebDriver Driver;\n\n    [SetUp]\n    public void SetUp()\n    {\n        Driver = new FirefoxDriver();\n    }\n\n    [TearDown]\n    public void TearDown()\n    {\n        Driver.Quit();\n    }\n// ...\n```\n\nHere is the markup from the first table we\'re working with. Note that it does not have any `id` or `class` attributes.\n\n```html\n<table id="table1" class="tablesorter">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th><span>Last Name</span></th>\n      <th><span>First Name</span></th>\n      <th><span>Email</span></th>\n      <th><span>Due</span></th>\n      <th><span>Web Site</span></th>\n      <th><span>Action</span></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Smith</td>\n      <td>John</td>\n      <td>jsmith@gmail.com</td>\n      <td>$50.00</td>\n      <td>http://www.jsmith.com</td>\n      <td>\n        <a href="#edit">edit</a>\n        <a href="#delete">delete</a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n```\n\nThere are 6 columns (`Last Name`, `First Name`, `Email`, `Due`, `Web Site`, and `Action`). Each one is sortable by clicking on the column header. The first click will sort them in ascending order, the second click in descending order.\n\nThere is a small sampling of data in the table to work with (4 rows worth), so we should be able to sort the data, grab it, and confirm that it sorted correctly. So let\'s do that in our first test with the `Due` column using a CSS Pseudo-class.\n\n```csharp\n// filename: Tables.cs\n// ...\n    [Test]\n    public void TableWithNoHelpfulMarkup1()\n    {\n        Driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables");\n        Driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(4)")).Click();\n\n        IReadOnlyCollection<IWebElement> Dues = Driver.FindElements(By.CssSelector("#table1 tbody tr td:nth-of-type(4)"));\n        List<double> FormattedDues = new List<double>();\n        foreach(IWebElement Due in Dues)\n        {\n            FormattedDues.Add(double.Parse(Due.Text.Replace("$", "")));\n        }\n\n        Assert.That(FormattedDues, Is.Ordered);\n    }\n// ...\n```\n\nAfter visiting the page we find and click the column heading that we want with a CSS Pseudo-class (e.g. `#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(4)`). This locator targets the 4th `<th>` element in the table heading section (e.g., `<thead>`) (which is the `Due` column heading).\n\nWe use another pseudo-class to find all `<td>` elements within the `Due` column by looking for the 4th `<td>` of each row in the table body. Once we have them we grab each of their text values, clean them up by removing the `$`, convert them to a number (e.g., `double`), and store them all in a collection called `FormattedDues`. We then assert that the collection is sorted in ascending order.\n\nIf we wanted to test for descending order, we would need to click the `Due` heading twice after loading the page. Other than that the code is identical except for the assertion.\n\n```csharp\n// filename: Tables.cs\n// ...\n    [Test]\n    public void TableWithNoHelpfulMarkup2()\n    {\n        Driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables");\n        Driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(4)")).Click();\n        Driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(4)")).Click();\n\n        IReadOnlyCollection<IWebElement> Dues = Driver.FindElements(By.CssSelector("#table1 tbody tr td:nth-of-type(4)"));\n        List<double> FormattedDues = new List<double>();\n        foreach(IWebElement Due in Dues)\n        {\n            FormattedDues.Add(double.Parse(Due.Text.Replace("$", "")));\n        }\n\n        Assert.That(FormattedDues, Is.Ordered.Descending);\n    }\n// ...\n```\n\nWe can easily use this locator strategy to test a different column (e.g., one that doesn\'t deal with numbers) and see that it gets sorted correctly too. Here\'s a test that exercises the `Email` column.\n\n```csharp\n// filename: Tables.cs\n// ...\n    [Test]\n    public void TableWithNoHelpfulMarkup3()\n    {\n        Driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables");\n        Driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(3)")).Click();\n\n        IReadOnlyCollection<IWebElement> Emails = Driver.FindElements(By.CssSelector("#table1 tbody tr td:nth-of-type(3)"));\n        List<string> FormattedEmails = new List<string>();\n        foreach(IWebElement Email in Emails)\n        {\n            FormattedEmails.Add(Email.Text);\n        }\n\n        Assert.That(FormattedEmails, Is.Ordered);\n    }\n// ...\n```\n\nThe mechanism for this is the same except that we don\'t need to clean the text up before performing our assertion (we just need to pull the text out of the `IWebElement` collection).\n\n## Example 2\n\nBut what about older browsers?\n\nIf we run these against an older browser (e.g., Internet Explorer 8, etc.) it will throw an exception stating `Unable to find element`. This is because older browsers don\'t support CSS Pseudo-classes.\n\nYou\'ve come a long way, so it\'s best to get value out of what you\'ve just written. To do that you can run these tests on **current browsers** and submit a request to your front-end developers to update the table markup with some semantic `class` attributes. Later, when these new locators have been implemented on the page, you can revisit these tests and update them accordingly.\n\nHere is markup of what our original table would look like with some helpful attributes added in. It\'s also the markup from the second example of [our application under test](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables).\n\n```html\n<table id="table2" class="tablesorter">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th><span class="last-name">Last Name</span></th>\n      <th><span class="first-name">First Name</span></th>\n      <th><span class="email">Email</span></th>\n      <th><span class="dues">Due</span></th>\n      <th><span class="web-site">Web Site</span></th>\n      <th><span class="action">Action</span></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td class="last-name">Smith</td>\n      <td class="first-name">John</td>\n      <td class="email">jsmith@gmail.com</td>\n      <td class="dues">$50.00</td>\n      <td class="web-site">http://www.jsmith.com</td>\n      <td class="action">\n        <a href="#edit">edit</a>\n        <a href="#delete">delete</a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n```\n\nWith these well-placed and descriptive class attributes the locators in our sorting tests become _a lot_ simpler to write and more expressive. Let\'s revisit sorting the `Due` column in ascending order in a new test.\n\n```csharp\n// filename: Tables.cs\n// ...\n    [Test]\n    public void TableWithHelpfulMarkup()\n    {\n        Driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables");\n        Driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("#table2 thead .dues")).Click();\n        IReadOnlyCollection<IWebElement> Dues = Driver.FindElements(By.CssSelector("#table2 tbody .dues"));\n        List<double> FormattedDues = new List<double>();\n        foreach(IWebElement Due in Dues)\n        {\n            FormattedDues.Add(double.Parse(Due.Text.Replace("$", "")));\n        }\n        Assert.That(FormattedDues, Is.Ordered);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNot only will these selectors work in current _and_ older browsers, but they are also more resilient to changes in the table layout since they are not using hard-coded numbers that rely on the column order.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen you save this file and run it (e.g., `nunit3-console.exe .\\Tables.sln` from the command-line) here is what will happen:\n\n- Open the browser\n- Load the page\n- Click the column heading\n- Grab the values for the column\n- Assert that the column values are sorted in the correct order (ascending or descending)\n- Close the browser\n\n## Summary\n\nCSS Pseudo-classes are a great resource and unlock a lot of potential for your tests; enabling a bit of CSS gymnastics assuming you\'ve come up with a test strategy that rules out older browsers. If you don\'t have a test strategy or are curious to see how yours compares, check out [tip 18](/docs/what-to-test/18-what-to-test).\n\nFor more info on CSS Pseudo-classes see [this write-up by Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/resources/selenium/css-selectors), and maybe [the W3C spec CSS3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#structural-pseudos) if you\'re feeling adventurous.

It's an example from [the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet). In the example there are 2 tables. We will start with the first table and then work with the second.__\n\nLet's start by importing our requisite classes (for annotations (e.g., `org.junit.After`, etc.), driving the browser with Selenium (e.g., `org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver`, etc.), and matchers for our assertions (e.g., `org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers`, etc.)) and start our class with some setup and teardown methods.\n\n```java\n// filename: Tables.java\nimport org.junit.After;\nimport org.junit.Before;\nimport org.junit.Test;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.By;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver;\nimport java.util.LinkedList;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.*;\nimport static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;\nimport static org.hamcrest.number.OrderingComparison.lessThan;\nimport static org.hamcrest.number.OrderingComparison.lessThanOrEqualTo;\nimport static org.hamcrest.number.OrderingComparison.greaterThanOrEqualTo;\n\npublic class Tables {\n    WebDriver driver;\n\n    @Before\n    public void setUp() throws Exception {\n        driver = new FirefoxDriver();\n\n    }\n\n    @After\n    public void tearDown() throws Exception {\n        driver.quit();\n    }\n// ...\n```\n\nHere is the markup from the first table we're working with. Note that it does not have any `id` or `class` attributes.\n\n```html\n<table id=\"table1\" class=\"tablesorter\">\n    <thead>\n      <tr>\n        <th><span>Last Name</span></th>\n        <th><span>First Name</span></th>\n        <th><span>Email</span></th>\n        <th><span>Due</span></th>\n        <th><span>Web Site</span></th>\n        <th><span>Action</span></th>\n      </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Smith</td>\n        <td>John</td>\n        <td>jsmith@gmail.com</td>\n        <td>$50.00</td>\n        <td>http://www.jsmith.com</td>\n        <td>\n          <a href='#edit'>edit</a>\n          <a href='#delete'>delete</a>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n```\n\nThere are 6 columns (`Last Name`, `First Name`, `Email`, `Due`, `Web Site`, and `Action`). Each one is sortable by clicking on the column header. The first click will sort them in ascending order, the second click in descending order.\n\nThere is a small sampling of data in the table to work with (4 rows worth), so we should be able to sort the data, grab it, and confirm that it sorted correctly. So let's do that in our first test with the `Due` column using a CSS Pseudo-class.\n\n```java\n// filename: Tables.java\n// ...\n    @Test\n    public void withoutHelpfulMarkupDuesAscending() {\n    {\n        driver.get(\"http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables\");\n        driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(\"#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(4)\")).click();\n\n        List<WebElement> dues = driver.findElements(By.cssSelector(\"#table1 tbody tr td:nth-of-type(4)\"));\n        List<Double> dueValues = new LinkedList<Double>();\n        for(WebElement element : dues){\n            dueValues.add(Double.parseDouble(element.getText().replace(\"$\", \"\")));\n        }\n\n        for(int counter = 0; counter < dueValues.size() - 1; counter++){\n            assertThat(dueValues.get(counter), is(lessThanOrEqualTo(dueValues.get(counter + 1))));\n        }\n    }\n// ...\n```\n\nAfter visiting the page we find and click the column heading that we want with a CSS Pseudo-class (e.g. `#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(4)`). This locator targets the 4th `<th>` element in the table heading section (e.g., `<thead>`) (which is the `Due` column heading).\n\nWe use another pseudo-class to find all `<td>` elements within the `Due` column by looking for the 4th `<td>` of each row in the table body. Once we have them we grab each of their text values, clean them up by removing the `$`, convert them to a number (e.g., `Double`), and store them all in a collection called `dueValues`. We then iterate through the collection and compare values that are next to each other to see if they're sorted correctly.\n\nIf we wanted to test for descending order, we would need to click the `Due` heading twice after loading the page. Other than that the code is identical except for the assertion which is checking that the adjacent value is `greaterThanOrEqual`.\n\n```java\n// filename: Tables.java\n// ...\n    @Test\n    public void withoutHelpfulMarkupDuesDescending() {\n        driver.get(\"http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables\");\n\n        driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(\"#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(4)\")).click();\n        driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(\"#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(4)\")).click();\n\n        List<WebElement> dues = driver.findElements(By.cssSelector(\"#table1 tbody tr td:nth-of-type(4)\"));\n        List<Double> dueValues = new LinkedList<Double>();\n        for (WebElement element : dues) {\n            dueValues.add(Double.parseDouble(element.getText().replace(\"$\", \"\")));\n        }\n\n        for (int counter = 0; counter < dueValues.size() - 1; counter++) {\n            assertThat(dueValues.get(counter), is(greaterThanOrEqualTo(dueValues.get(counter + 1))));\n        }\n    }\n// ...\n```\n\nWe can easily use this locator strategy to test a different column (e.g., one that doesn't deal with numbers) and see that it gets sorted correctly too. Here's a test that exercises the `Email` column.\n\n```java\n// filename: Tables.java\n// ...\n    @Test\n    public void withoutHelpfulMarkupEmailAscending() {\n        driver.get(\"http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables\");\n\n        driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(\"#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(3)\")).click();\n\n        List<WebElement> emails = driver.findElements(By.cssSelector(\"#table1 tbody tr td:nth-of-type(3)\"));\n        for(int counter = 0; counter < emails.size() -1; counter++){\n            assertThat(\n                    emails.get(counter).getText().compareTo(emails.get(counter + 1).getText()),\n                    is(lessThan(0)));\n        }\n    }\n// ...\n```\n\nThe mechanism for this is the same except that we don't need to clean the text up or convert it before performing our assertion. And our assertion is using `compareTo` which returns a number based on the result. A negative number means that it's ascending, a positive number descending, and a `0` means the two values are equal.\n\n## Example 2\n\nBut What About Older Browsers?\n\nNow we have some working tests that will load the page and check sorting for a couple of columns in both ascending and descending order. Great! But if we run these again an older browser (e.g., Internet Explorer 8, etc.) it will throw an exception stating `Unable to find element`. This is because older browsers don't support CSS Pseudo-classes.\n\nYou've come a long way, so it's best to get value out of what you've just written. To do that you can run these tests on __current browsers__ and submit a request to your front-end developers to update the table's markup with some semantic `class` attributes. Later, when these new locators have been implemented on the page, you can revisit these tests and update them accordingly.\n\nHere is markup of what our original table would look like with some helpful attributes added in. It's also the markup from the second table on [the example page](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables).\n\n```html\n<table id=\"table2\" class=\"tablesorter\">\n    <thead>\n      <tr>\n        <th><span class='last-name'>Last Name</span></th>\n        <th><span class='first-name'>First Name</span></th>\n        <th><span class='email'>Email</span></th>\n        <th><span class='dues'>Due</span></th>\n        <th><span class='web-site'>Web Site</span></th>\n        <th><span class='action'>Action</span></th>\n      </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td class='last-name'>Smith</td>\n        <td class='first-name'>John</td>\n        <td class='email'>jsmith@gmail.com</td>\n        <td class='dues'>$50.00</td>\n        <td class='web-site'>http://www.jsmith.com</td>\n        <td class='action'>\n          <a href='#edit'>edit</a>\n          <a href='#delete'>delete</a>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n```\n\nWith these well-placed, descriptive class attributes our sorting tests become _a lot_ simpler and more expressive. Let's revisit sorting the `Due` column in ascending order in a new test.\n\n```java\n// filename: Tables.java\n// ...\n    @Test\n    public void withHelpfulMarkup()\n    {\n        driver.get(\"http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables\");\n        driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(\"#table2 thead .dues\")).click();\n        List<WebElement> dues = driver.findElements(By.cssSelector(\"#table2 tbody .dues\"));\n        List<Double> dueValues = new LinkedList<Double>();\n        for(WebElement element : dues){\n            dueValues.add(Double.parseDouble(element.getText().replace(\"$\", \"\")));\n        }\n        for(int counter = 0; counter < dueValues.size() - 1; counter++){\n            assertThat(dueValues.get(counter), is(lessThanOrEqualTo(dueValues.get(counter + 1))));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNot only will these selectors work in current _and_ older browsers, but they are also more resilient to changes in the table layout since they are not using hard-coded numbers that rely on the column order.\n\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen you save this file and run it (e.g., `mvn clean test` from the command-line) here is what will happen:\n\n+ Open the browser\n+ Load the page\n+ Click the column heading\n+ Grab the values for the column\n+ Assert that the column values are sorted in the correct order (ascending or descending)\n+ Close the browser\n\n## Summary\n\nCSS Pseudo-classes are a great resource and unlock a lot of potential for your tests; enabling a bit of CSS gymnastics assuming you've come up with a test strategy that rules out older browsers.

This locator targets the 4th `<th>` element in the table heading section (e.g., `<thead>`) (which is the `Due` column heading).\n\nWe then use another pseudo-class to find all `<td>` elements within the `Due` column by looking for the 4th `<td>` of each row in the table body. Once we have them we grab each of their text values, clean them up (`.replace(\'$\',\'\')`), convert them to a number (`Number()`), and store them all in a array called `dues`. We then compare this collection to a sorted version of itself to see if they match. If they do, then the `Due` column was sorted in ascending order and the test will pass.\n\nIf we wanted to test for descending order, we would need to click the `Due` heading twice after loading the page. Other than that the code is identical except for the assertion which is checking the same thing but reversing the sort order.\n\n```javascript\n// filename: test/tables.spec.js\n// ...\n  it("should sort number column in descending order", async function() {\n    await driver.get("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables");\n    await driver\n      .findElement(By.css("#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(4)"))\n      .click();\n    await driver\n      .findElement(By.css("#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(4)"))\n      .click();\n    const due_column = await driver.findElements(\n      By.css("#table1 tbody tr td:nth-of-type(4)")\n    );\n    let dues = [];\n    for (const entry in due_column) {\n      const text = await due_column[entry].getText();\n      dues.push(Number(text.replace("$", "")));\n    }\n    assert(dues === dues.sort().reverse());\n  });\n// ...\n```\n\nWe can easily use this approach to test a different column (e.g., one that doesn\'t deal with numbers) and see that it gets sorted correctly too.

We will start with the first table and then work with the second.__\n\nWe kick things off by pulling in our requisite libraries (`import unittest` for our test framework and `from selenium import webdriver` to drive the browser), declare our test class, and wire up some test `setUp` and `tearDown` methods.\n\n```python\n# filename: tables.py\nimport unittest\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\n\n\nclass Tables(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        self.driver = webdriver.Firefox()\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        self.driver.quit()\n\n# ...\n```\n\nHere is the markup from the first table example we're working with. Note that it does not have any `id` or `class` attributes.\n\n```html\n<table id=\"table1\" class=\"tablesorter\">\n    <thead>\n      <tr>\n        <th><span>Last Name</span></th>\n        <th><span>First Name</span></th>\n        <th><span>Email</span></th>\n        <th><span>Due</span></th>\n        <th><span>Web Site</span></th>\n        <th><span>Action</span></th>\n      </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Smith</td>\n        <td>John</td>\n        <td>jsmith@gmail.com</td>\n        <td>$50.00</td>\n        <td>http://www.jsmith.com</td>\n        <td>\n          <a href='#edit'>edit</a>\n          <a href='#delete'>delete</a>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n```\n\nThere are 6 columns (`Last Name`, `First Name`, `Email`, `Due`, `Web Site`, and `Action`). Each one is sortable by clicking on the column header. The first click should sort them in ascending order, the second click in descending order.\n\nThere is a small sampling of data in the table to work with (4 rows worth). So we should be able to sort the data, grab it, and confirm that it sorted correctly. So lets do that in our first test with the `Due` column using a CSS Pseudo Class.\n\n```python\n# filename: tables.py\n# ...\n  def test_sort_number_column_in_ascending_order_with_limited_locators(self):\n      driver = self.driver\n      driver.get('http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables')\n      WebDriverWait(driver, 20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.CSS_SELECTOR,'#table1 thead tr th:nth-child(4)'))).click()\n      due_column = driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR,'#table1 tbody tr td:nth-child(4)')\n      dues = [float(due.text.replace('$','')) for due in due_column]\n      assert dues == sorted(dues)\n\n# ...\n```\n\nAfter loading the page we find and click the column heading that we want with a CSS Pseudo-class (e.g. `#table1 thead tr th:nth-child(4)`). This locator targets the 4th `<th>` element in the table heading section (e.g., `<thead>`) (which is the `Due` column heading).\n\nWe then use another pseudo-class to find all `<td>` elements within the `Due` column by looking for the 4th `<td>` of each row in the table body. Once we have them we grab each of their text values, clean them up (`.replace('$','')`), convert them to a number (`flat()`), and store them all in a list called `dues`. We then compare this collection to a sorted version of itself to see if they match. If they do, then the `Due` column was sorted in ascending order and the test will pass.\n\nIf we wanted to test for descending order, we would need to click the `Due` heading twice after loading the page. Other than that the code is identical except for the assertion which is checking the same thing but reversing the sort order.\n\n```python\n# filename: tables.py\n# ...\n    def test_sort_number_column_in_descending_order_with_limited_locators(self):\n        driver = self.driver\n        driver.get('http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables')\n        WebDriverWait(driver, 20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.CSS_SELECTOR,'#table1 thead tr th:nth-child(4)'))).click()\n        WebDriverWait(driver, 20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.CSS_SELECTOR,'#table1 thead tr th:nth-child(4)'))).click()\n        due_column = driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR,'#table1 tbody tr td:nth-child(4)')\n        dues = [float(due.text.replace('$','')) for due in due_column]\n        assert dues == sorted(dues, reverse=True)\n\n# ...\n```\n\nWe can easily use this approach to test a different column (e.g., one that doesn't deal with numbers) and see that it gets sorted correctly too. Here's a test that exercises the `Email` column.\n\n```python\n# filename: tables.py\n# ...\n    def test_sort_text_column_in_ascending_order_with_limited_locators(self):\n        driver = self.driver\n        driver.get('http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables')\n        WebDriverWait(driver, 20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.CSS_SELECTOR,'#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(3)'))).click()\n        email_column = driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR,'#table1 tbody tr td:nth-of-type(3)')\n        emails = [email.text for email in email_column]\n        assert emails == sorted(emails)\n\n# ...\n```\n\nThe mechanism for this is the same as before, except that we don't need to clean the text up or convert it before performing our assertion.\n\n### But What About Older Browsers?\n\nNow we have some working tests that will load the page and check sorting for a couple of columns in both ascending and descending order. Great! But if we run these again an older browser (e.g., Internet Explorer 8, etc.) it will throw an exception stating `Unable to find element`. This is because older browsers don't support CSS Pseudo-classes.\n\nYou've come a long way, so it's best to get value out of what you've just written. To do that you can run these tests on __current browsers__ and submit a request to your front-end developers to update the table markup with some semantic `class` attributes. Later, when these new locators have been implemented on the page, you can revisit these tests and update them accordingly.\n\nHere is markup of what our original table would look like with some helpful attributes added in. It's also the markup from the second table on [our application under test](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables).\n\n```html\n<table id=\"table2\" class=\"tablesorter\">\n    <thead>\n      <tr>\n        <th><span class='last-name'>Last Name</span></th>\n        <th><span class='first-name'>First Name</span></th>\n        <th><span class='email'>Email</span></th>\n        <th><span class='dues'>Due</span></th>\n        <th><span class='web-site'>Web Site</span></th>\n        <th><span class='action'>Action</span></th>\n      </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td class='last-name'>Smith</td>\n        <td class='first-name'>John</td>\n        <td class='email'>jsmith@gmail.com</td>\n        <td class='dues'>$50.00</td>\n        <td class='web-site'>http://www.jsmith.com</td>\n        <td class='action'>\n          <a href='#edit'>edit</a>\n          <a href='#delete'>delete</a>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n```\n\nWith these new attributes the locators in our sorting tests become a lot simpler and more expressive. Let's write a new `Due` ascending order test to demonstrate.\n\n```python\n# filename: tables.py\n# ...\n    def test_sort_number_column_in_ascending_order_with_helpful_locators(self):\n        driver = self.driver\n        driver.get('http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables')\n        WebDriverWait(driver, 20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.CSS_SELECTOR,'#table2 thead .dues'))).click()\n        due_column = driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR,'#table2 tbody .dues')\n        dues = [float(due.text.replace('$','')) for due in due_column]\n        assert dues == sorted(dues)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nNot only will these selectors work in current _and_ older browsers, but they are also more resilient to changes in the table layout since they are not using hard-coded numbers that rely on the column order.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen we save this file and run it (e.g., `python tables.py` from the command-line) here is what will happen:\n\n+ Browser opens\n+ Load the page\n+ Click the column heading\n+ Grab the values for the target column\n+ Assert that the column is sorted in the correct order (ascending or descending depending on the test)\n+ Close the browser\n\n## Summary\n\nCSS Pseudo-classes are a great resource and unlock a lot of potential for your tests. They enable a bit of CSS gymnastics but that's only assuming you've come up with a test strategy that rules out older browsers. If you don't have a test strategy or are curious to see how yours compares, check out [tip 18](/docs/what-to-test/18-what-to-test).\n\nFor more info on CSS Pseudo-classes see [this write-up by Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/resources/selenium/css-selectors), and maybe [the W3C spec for CSS3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#structural-pseudos) if you're feeling adventurous.

Depending on your application it can be quite common and\nsomething you will want to write an automated test for.\n\nWhen the table has no helpful, semantic markup (e.g. easy to use `id` or `class` attributes) it quickly becomes more\ndifficult to work with and write tests against it. And if you're able to pull something together, it will likely not\nwork against older browsers.\n\n## A Solution\n\nYou can easily traverse a table through the use of [CSS Pseudo-classes](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp).\n\nBut keep in mind that if you care about older browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer 8, et al), then this approach won't\nwork on them. In those cases your best bet is to find a workable solution for the short term and get a front-end\ndeveloper to update the table with helpful attributes.\n\n> ### A quick primer on Tables and CSS Pseudo-classes\n> Understanding the broad strokes of an HTML table's structure goes a long way in writing effective automation against it. So here's a quick primer.\n> A table has:- a header (e.g. `<thead>`)- a body (e.g. `<tbody>`).- rows (e.g. `<tr>`) -- horizontal slats of data- columns -- vertical slats of data\n> Columns are made up of cells, which are:- a header (e.g., `<th>`)- one or more standard cells (e.g., `<td>` -- which is short for **table data**)CSS Pseudo-classes work by walking through the structure of an object and targeting a specific part of it based ona relative number (e.g. the **third** `<td>` cell from a row in the table body). This works well with tables sincewe can grab all instances of a target (e.g. the third `<td>` cell from each `<tr>` in the table body) and use it in\n> our test -- which would give us all of the data for the third column.\n\nLet's step through some examples for a common set of table functionality like sorting columns in ascending and descending order.\n\n\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},\n    {label: 'C#', value: 'csharp'},\n    {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},\n    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript'},\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals.

You can sign up for a\n[free trial account (no credit-card required)](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up).\n\nFirst we'll include our dependent libraries (to drive the browser and do assertions), and wire up some simple\n`setup`, `teardown`, and `run` methods. We recommend exporting your Sauce Labs `SAUCE_USERNAME` and\n`SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` as environment variables.\n\nHere are instructions for setting environment variables on each Operating System:\n\n* [Windows](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/08/31/how-to-change-environment-variables-on-windows-10/)\n* [macOS](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106778/how-do-i-set-environment-variables-on-os-x)\n* [Linux](https://askubuntu.com/questions/58814/how-do-i-add-environment-variables)\n\n```ruby\n# filename: cloud.rb\n\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rspec/expectations'\ninclude RSpec::Matchers\n\ndef setup\n  options = Selenium::WebDriver::Options.chrome\n  options.browser_version = '109'\n  options.platform_name = 'macOS 13'\n  sauce_options = {}\n  sauce_options[:name] = 'Elemental Selenium - Tip 26 - Hello!'\n  options.add_option('sauce:options', sauce_options)\n\n  url = \"https://#{ENV['SAUCE_USERNAME']}:#{ENV['SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY']}@ondemand.us-west-1.saucelabs.com:443/wd/hub\"\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for(:remote, :url => url, :capabilities => options)\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n```\n\nOur `setup` method is where the magic is happening. We declare the browser options\nfor Chrome and store it in a variable for immediate reuse. We then set the browser version\n(e.g. `options.browser_version = '109'`, but you can also use `latest` to use the most recent\nversion), specify the operating system we would like to use (e.g. `options.platform_name = 'macOS 13'`),\nand set the test name (e.g., `sauce_options[:name] = 'Elemental Selenium - Tip 26 - Hello!'`).\n\nWe then connect to Sauce Labs with Selenium WebDriver and feed in our browser options object.\n\n**NOTE**: The URL contains the URI for the Sauce Labs cl service as well as our Sauce user and\naccess credentials. In this case, they are specified through environment variables. But you can\njust as easily hard-code your info here. We recommend exporting your Sauce Labs `SAUCE_USERNAME` and\n`SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` as environment variables.\n\nHere are instructions for setting environment variables on each Operating System:\n\n* [Windows](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/08/31/how-to-change-environment-variables-on-windows-10/)\n* [macOS](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106778/how-do-i-set-environment-variables-on-os-x)\n* [Linux](https://askubuntu.com/questions/58814/how-do-i-add-environment-variables)\n\nNow we're ready to add a test to run in Sauce Labs.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com'\n  expect(@driver.title.include?('The Internet')).to eql true\nend\n```\n\nIf we save this and run it (e.g., `ruby cloud.rb` from the command-line) it will execute the test on\nan Chrome 109 browser instance running on macOS 13 (Ventura) in Sauce Labs.\n\n## Another Browser\n\nIf you want to change up the browser, you would just need to alter the options:\n\n```ruby\n  # For Chrome 110\n  options = Selenium::WebDriver::Options.chrome\n  options.browser_version = '110'\n```\n\nOr...\n\n```ruby\n  # For Safari 16\n  options = Selenium::WebDriver::Options.safari\n  options.browser_version = '16'\n```\n\nOr...\n\n```ruby\n  # For Edge 109\n  options = Selenium::WebDriver::Options.edge\n  options.browser_version = '109'\n```\n\n**NOTE**: You can find a full list of configuration options along with example code for all of Sauce supported\nlanguages at their [Platform Configurator](https://saucelabs.com/products/platform-configurator#/).\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n- Open a specified browser in Sauce Labs\n- Test runs\n- Browser closes\n- Test results (along with a video recording, screenshots, and other debugging information) are available on the\n[test results dashboard](https://docs.saucelabs.com/test-results/viewing-test-results/).\n\n## Summary\n\nHopefully this tip has helped you get your tests up and running against numerous browsers.\n\nThere are some other things to consider when using Sauce Labs (e.g., testing your secure apps through\n[Sauce Connect](https://docs.saucelabs.com/secure-connections/sauce-connect/), setting the pass/fail status\nfor your tests, and dynamically setting the test name).

Someone Elses Grid). There are a handful of players in this space, but there's one that stands out --\n[Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/).\n\nAt the heart of Selenium at scale is the use of Selenium Grid. Selenium Grid lets you distribute test execution across\nseveral machines and you connect to it with [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/).\nWith Selenium WebDriver you specify the browser type, browser version, and operating system.\n\nThis is fundamentally how Sauce Labs works. Behind the curtain they are ultimately running Selenium Grid, and they\nreceive and execute your tests through Selenium WebDriver.\n\nHere is an example.\n\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n"},73191:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="### A brief primer on Good Test Writing\n\nIn order to write tests that work well in parallel there are some simple guidelines to follow:\n\n+ Write atomic and autonomous tests\n+ Group like tests together in small batches\n+ Be descriptive\n+ Use a Test Runner\n\n#### Atomic & Autonomous Tests\n\nEach test needs to be concise (e.g. testing a single feature rather than multiple features) and be able to be run independently (e.g. sets up it's own data rather than relying on a previous test to do it). Doing this may require a mental shift, discipline, and more up front effort. But __it will make a dramatic impact on the quality, effectiveness, and maintainability of your tests__.\n\n#### Grouping Tests\n\nAs your test suite grows you should have multiple test files, each containing a small grouping of tests broken out by functionality that they're exercising. This will go a long way towards organization and maintenance as your test suite grows -- as well as faster execution times (depending on your approach to parallelization).\n\n#### Being Descriptive\n\nEach test file should be named appropriately, and each test within it should have an informative name (even if it may be a bit verbose). Also, each test (or grouping of tests) should be tagged for flexible execution later (e.g. on a Continuous Integration server).\n\nThis way you can run parts of your test suite as needed, and the results will be informative thanks to helpful naming.\n\n#### Test Runners\n\nAt the heart of every testing framework is a test runner that does a lot of the heavy lifting (e.g. test group execution, easy global configuration for setup and teardown, reporting, etc.).\n\nSo rather than reinvent the wheel, you can use one of the many that already exists (there's more than one for every language). And with it, you can bolt on third party libraries to extend it's functionality if there's something missing -- like parallelization.\n\n\n## Example\n\n__NOTE: For this example we will be using [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) as the Test Runner and [parallel-tests](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests) for parallelization.__\n\nIn RSpec, test files are referred to as 'specs'. So for our initial spec I've used the test code \nfrom [a previous tip on working with Data Tables](https://elementalselenium.com/docs/how-to-work-with-tables/25-tables). \nDon't get too distracted by what the test steps are doing, the organization and naming of things is more important \nfor this example.\n\n```ruby\n# data_table_sorting_spec.rb\n\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\n\ndescribe 'Data Table Sorting' do\n\n  before(:each) do\n    @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox\n  end\n\n  after(:each) do\n    @driver.quit\n  end\n\n  context 'Without Attributes' do\n\n    it 'in Ascending Order' do\n      @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables'\n      @driver.find_element(css: '#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(4)').click\n      dues = @driver.find_elements(css: '#table1 tbody tr td:nth-of-type(4)')\n      due_values = []\n      dues.each { |due| due_values << due.text.gsub(/\\$/,'').to_i }\n      (due_values == due_values.sort).should == true\n    end\n\n    it 'in Descending Order' do\n      @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables'\n      @driver.find_element(css: '#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(4)').click\n      @driver.find_element(css: '#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(4)').click\n      dues = @driver.find_elements(css: '#table1 tbody tr td:nth-of-type(4)')\n      due_values = []\n      dues.each { |due| due_values << due.text.gsub(/\\$/,'').to_i }\n      (due_values == due_values.sort).should == false\n    end\n\n  end\n\n  context 'With Attributes' do\n\n    it 'in Ascending Order' do\n      @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables'\n      @driver.find_element(css: '#table2 thead .dues').click\n      dues = @driver.find_elements(css: '#table2 tbody .dues')\n      due_values = []\n      dues.each { |due| due_values << due.text.gsub(/\\$/,'').to_f }\n      (due_values == due_values.sort).should == true\n    end\n\n    it 'in Descending Order' do\n      @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables'\n      @driver.find_element(css: '#table2 thead .dues').click\n      @driver.find_element(css: '#table2 thead .dues').click\n      dues = @driver.find_elements(css: '#table2 tbody .dues')\n      due_values = []\n      dues.each { |due| due_values << due.text.gsub(/\\$/,'').to_f }\n      (due_values == due_values.sort).should == false\n    end\n\n  end\n\nend\n```\n\nAt the top of the file we include our dependent library (`selenium-webdriver`) and declare the name of our test group ('Sort Data Table') with a `describe` statement. We then wire up our before and after actions which are responsible for setting up and tearing down an instance of Selenium for each test. Each of our tests are grouped into logical separations using `context` blocks and defined within an `it` block.\n\nIf we run this (e.g. with the command `rspec data_table_sorting_spec.rb`) it will fire up one browser at a time until each test is completed. And If we download, install, and run it through [parallel_tests](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests) (e.g. with the command `paralell_rspec data_table_sorting_spec.rb`) -- the same thing would happen. Why? Because parallel_tests executes things at the file level rather than at the individual test level (this holds true even when running tests by tag).\n\nIn order to take advantage of parallelization we will need to break these tests up into different files.\n\nBut before we do that we can simplify our test code by abstracting out our setup and teardown actions into a central place (known as a `spec_helper` in the RSpec parlance).\n\n```ruby\n# spec_helper.rb\n\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\n\nRSpec.configure do |config|\n\n  config.before(:each) do\n    @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox\n  end\n\n  config.after(:each) do\n    @driver.quit\n  end\n\nend\n```\n\nNow that we have that we can create a new spec file and place some of our tests in it.\n\n```ruby\n# data_table_sorting_with_attributes_spec.rb\n\nrequire 'spec_helper'\n\ndescribe 'Sort Data Table' do\n\n  context 'With Attributes' do\n\n    it 'in Ascending Order' do\n      @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables'\n      @driver.find_element(css: '#table2 thead .dues').click\n      dues = @driver.find_elements(css: '#table2 tbody .dues')\n      due_values = []\n      dues.each { |due| due_values << due.text.gsub(/\\$/,'').to_f }\n      (due_values == due_values.sort).should == true\n    end\n\n    it 'in Descending Order' do\n      @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables'\n      @driver.find_element(css: '#table2 thead .dues').click\n      @driver.find_element(css: '#table2 thead .dues').click\n      dues = @driver.find_elements(css: '#table2 tbody .dues')\n      due_values = []\n      dues.each { |due| due_values << due.text.gsub(/\\$/,'').to_f }\n      (due_values == due_values.sort).should == false\n    end\n\n  end\n\nend\n```\n\nNotice that the require statement has changed from `selenium-webdriver` to `spec_helper`. Since we abstracted things \nout into a spec_helper file we now need to require it in all of our specs -- and the dependent libraries \nfor our test suite live there instead.\n\n```ruby\n# data_table_sorting_without_attributes_spec.rb\n\nrequire 'spec_helper'\n\ndescribe 'Sort Data Table' do\n\n  context 'Without Attributes' do\n\n    it 'in Ascending Order' do\n      @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables'\n      @driver.find_element(css: '#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(4)').click\n      dues = @driver.find_elements(css: '#table1 tbody tr td:nth-of-type(4)')\n      due_values = []\n      dues.each { |due| due_values << due.text.gsub(/\\$/,'').to_i }\n      (due_values == due_values.sort).should == true\n    end\n\n    it 'in Descending Order' do\n      @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables'\n      @driver.find_element(css: '#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(4)').click\n      @driver.find_element(css: '#table1 thead tr th:nth-of-type(4)').click\n      dues = @driver.find_elements(css: '#table1 tbody tr td:nth-of-type(4)')\n      due_values = []\n      dues.each { |due| due_values << due.text.gsub(/\\$/,'').to_i }\n      (due_values == due_values.sort).should == false\n    end\n\n  end\n\nend\n```\n\nTo get this last file we could have renamed the original test file, or created it anew and deleted the original.\n\nNotice that the `describe` name is the same between test files (e.g. 'Sort Data Table'). In RSpec names \ndo not need to be unique, and these tests logically fit together, this is a welcome consistency.\n\nNow when we run our tests through parallel_tests we get concurrent test runs with two browsers firing at \nthe same time, yielding (in this case) roughly a 30% drop in execution times (e.g. 17 seconds down to 12 seconds). \nYou can easily up the number of processes being run as a command-line argument (e.g. `-n 5`). But this will only \nmake a difference as you have more specs given how parallel_tests groups and executes things.\n\nNow that we have a working example that runs concurrently, we can point it at a cloud offering like Sauce Labs, \nand have access to any browser we want. We just have to update our setup action in the `spec_helper`.\n\n__NOTE: This was covered in a previous tip. For a full write-up, go [here](https://elementalselenium.com/docs/cloud/26-cloud).__\n\n```ruby\n# spec_helper.rb\n\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\n\nRSpec.configure do |config|\n\n  config.before(:each) do\n    caps = Selenium::WebDriver::Remote::Capabilities.firefox\n    caps.browser_version = \"115\"\n    caps.platform_name = \"Windows 11\"\n    caps[:name] = self.example.metadata[:full_description]\n\n    @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for(\n      :remote,\n      :url => \"https://SAUCE_USERNAME:SAUCE_API_KEY@ondemand.saucelabs.com/wd/hub\",\n      :capabilities => caps)\n  end\n\n  config.after(:each) do\n    @driver.quit\n  end\n\nend\n```\n\nNow when we run our tests with parallel_tests we can see the concurrent execution happening in Sauce Labs.\n\nSauce Labs is built to handle your tests concurrently, so you should be able to turn the number of processes up with no sweat. You will just need to be cogniscent of how many parallel tests your account has access to (e.g. 3 for Sauce Open accounts).\n\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n- Several browsers open in parallel\n- Each test runs in a different browser\n- All browsers close\n- If Sauce Labs was used, then the test results (along with a video recording, screenshots, and other debugging information) are available on the [test results dashboard](https://docs.saucelabs.com/test-results/viewing-test-results/).\n\n## Summary\n\nHopefully this tip has helped steer you on a path towards better test writing and parallelization.\n\nStay tuned for future tips where we'll cover how to take full advantage of your test suite by wiring it into a Continuous Integration server and making the requisite changes to your test runner.\n\nHappy Testing!\n"},98253:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'How to Speed Up Your Tests With Parallelization'\nid: '27-parallel'\nslug: /27-parallel\nsidebar_label: Parallelization\ndescription: \"Compared to Unit and Integration Tests, Selenium is slow.

This is especially\ntrue with the upcoming release of Selenium 3 where minimal support will be offered for RC (details of which you\ncan learn more about from [a Selenium Hangout with Simon Stewart](https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2013/selenium-hangout-2-recap/)).\n\nBut how do you approach an upgrade like this? Especially if you have an enormous amount of Selenium RC tests that\nyou rely on?\n\n## A Solution\n\nTake Jason Leyba's advice. He works at Google and oversaw the transition of their tests from Selenium RC to WebDriver.\nAnd he posits that it can be done by following 4 simple steps:\n\n+ Clean up your tests\n+ Swap in WebDriver-backed Selenium\n+ Use WebDriver for all new features\n+ Replace RC usage as tests break\n\nTo give you some context, Google's Selenium tests spawn something on the order of _3 million unique browser sessions\nper day_. And they were able to make this transition happen with minimal disruption. If they were able to make this\nhappen at such a scale, then hopefully this serves as inspiration for you to do the same at your organization.\n\n__NOTE: Jason discussed this in detail in [his keynote talk at Selenium Conf 2013 in Boston](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSLmfegT36A). His talking\npoints and code examples are recapped below. You can watch his full talk [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSLmfegT36A).__\n\n\n## 4 Simple Steps\n\n### 1. Clean Up Your Tests\n\n> \"Turns out that tests that are easy to maintain are tests that are easy to migrate.\" -- Jason Leyba\n\nThe best thing you can do to keep your tests clean is to practice good abstractions. In the simplest form this\nmeans not referencing Selenium commands directly in your tests -- pulling these out into something akin to page\nobjects instead.\n\n__NOTE: You can read more about how to accomplish this in [tip 9](https://elementalselenium.com/docs/use-a-base-page-object/9-use-a-base-page-object).\n\n### 2. Swap in WebDriver-backed Selenium\n\nWith WebDriver-backed Selenium you get two driver instances to use in your tests -- one for Selenium RC and another\nfor WebDriver. This enables you to keep your Selenium RC tests running while simultaneously building out WebDriver\nfunctionality as you transition things over.\n\nYou can see an example of what this looks like [here](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Ruby-Bindings#webdriver-backed-selenium).\n\n### 3. & 4. Improve Things Incrementally\n\nFor every new feature you write tests for, use WebDriver. And as your Selenium RC tests break go back and\nreplace the broken bits with WebDriver.\n\nChip away at this over time and you'll eventually be upgraded.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\nThere are a handful of pitfalls to be aware of when stepping through this upgrade.\n\n### Alert Handling\n\nWebDriver handles JavaScript alerts in a fundamentally different and incompatible way between Selenium RC and WebDriver\nthat won't work in WebDriver-backed Selenium.\n\nThe best way to address this is to port your alert handling from Selenium RC to WebDriver -- which is pretty\nstraightforward and should be easy to accomplish assuming you have things well abstracted (re: Step #1 above).\n\nHere is an example of the difference, in `Java`:\n\n```java\n// Selenium RC\nselenium.chooseCancelOnNextConfirmation();\nselenium.click(\"id=foo\");\n\n// WebDriver\nwebdriver.findElement(By.id(\"foo\")).click();\nwebdriver.switchTo().alert().dismiss();\n```\n\n### Waiting For The Page To Load\n\nThere's no need to explicitly wait for the page to load anymore since WebDriver can implicitly do this for us.\n\nHere's an example, in `Java`:\n\n```java\n// Selenium RC\nselenium.open(\"http://www.google.com\");\nselenium.waitForPageToLoad();\nselenium.typeKeys(\"name=q\", \"bears\");\n\n// WebDriver\nselenium.open(\"http://www.google.com\");\nselenium.typeKeys(\"name=q\", \"bears\");\n```\n\nIf you run into timing issues with this newer approach, consider adding an explicit wait for the element you want\nto interact with.\n\n__NOTE: For more insight into implicit and explicit waits, check out [tip 47](https://elementalselenium.com/docs/waiting/47-waiting).__\n\n### Getting Text From The Page\n\nIt's an expensive operation (and overkill) to get __ALL__ the text from the page to make a verification. And\nit takes longer to execute this in WebDriver.\n\nA better approach is to find the element that has the text you want and check it's text instead. Alternatively,\nif you want to search the entire page, it's better to get the page's _source_ and parse that.\n\n```java\n// Example in Java\n\n// Slow and unnecessary\nString text = selenium.getBodyText();\nassertTrue(text.contains(\"hello\"));\n\n// Targeted and fast\nWebElement body = webdriver.findElement(By.tagName(\"body\"));\nString text = body.getText();\nassertTrue(text.contains(\"hello\"));\n```\n\n### Be careful with JavaScript\n\nWebDriver-backed Selenium is not built for performance. It's meant to be a transitional tool. So things will run\nslower in it. The worst offender being when you issue JavaScript commands directly to the Selenium Core API. So do\nyour best to avoid things like this.\n\n```java\n// Example in java\n\nselenium.getEval(\n     \"selenium.isElementPresent('id=foo') && \" +\n     \"selenium.isVisible('id=foo')\");\n```\n\n### Inertia\n\nIt's worth noting that the hardest part of Google's transition wasn't technical. Teams were really slow to\nadopt WebDriver -- even when the tools were readily available, well documented, and easy to use. Jason and\nhis team were able to persevere and succeed through various means (e.g carrot, stick, elbow grease, etc.), but\nthis really slowed their progress.\n\nIf you find yourself in a similar situation at your organization, it's worth giving\n[Jason's talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSLmfegT36A) a watch for inspiration.\n\n## Summary\n\nIf you're faced with a similar upgrade in your future hopefully this tip has helped prepare you for what lies ahead.\n\nHappy Testing!\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's\nread by thousands of testing professionals.

With it, we are effectively grabbing the full path of the project directory and appending the `Vendor` directory to it. This is then put to use when creating an instance of Chrome (e.g., `Driver = new ChromeDriver(VendorDirectory);`).\n\nNow we\'re ready to add a test.\n\n```csharp\n// filename: Chrome.cs\n// ...\n    [Test]\n    public void PageLoads()\n    {\n        Driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com");\n        Assert.That(Driver.Title.Equals("The Internet"));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf we save this file and run the project (e.g., `nunit3-console.exe .\\Chrome.sln`) it will launch an instance of Chrome, visit the homepage of [the-internet](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/), and assert that the page title loaded.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen you save this file and run the project (e.g., `nunit3-console.exe .\\Chrome.sln` from the command-line) here is what will happen.\n\n- ChromeDriver starts\n- Chrome opens\n- Test runs\n- Chrome closes\n- ChromeDriver stops\n\n## Summary\n\nHopefully this tip has helped you get a better handle on how WebDriver works with various browsers and saved you some time in your configuration setup.

Thankfully Selenium has a method that enables us to quickly jump back to the top level of the page --\n`switch_to.default_content`.\n\n### Executing the Test\n\nBefore executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `Gemfile` file.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>Gemfile</code> file.</summary>\n    <div>\n        <TipCode codePath={"3-work-with-frames/code/ruby/Gemfile"} language={"txt"}/>\n    </div>\n</details>\n\nFinally, we can run the test by executing `ruby frames.rb` from the command-line.'},55366:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='import TipCode from "@site/src/components/tipCode";\n\n## TL;DR - Show Me The Code\n\n<TipCode codePath={"3-work-with-frames/code/selenide/src/test/java/com/elemental/selenium/FramesTest.java"}\n         language={"java"}/>\n\n## Code Walkthrough\n\n### Importing Libraries\n\nFirst, we pull in our requisite classes\n * for annotations (e.g., `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test`),\n * opening the browser with Selenide (e.g., `com.codeborne.selenide.Selenide.open`),\n * Selenide api for frames (e.g., `com.codeborne.selenide.Selenide.switchTo`)\n\n### Example 1\n\nOur first test is `exampleOne`. In it, we\'ll step through [an example of nested frames](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/nested_frames) from\n[the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet).\n\nWith Selenide\'s `.switchTo()` method we can easily switch to the frame we want. When using it for frames\n(e.g., `driver.switchTo().frame();`) it accepts either an ID or name attribute. But in order to get the text of the\nmiddle frame (e.g., a frame nested within another frame), we need to switch to the parent frame (e.g., the top frame)\nfirst _and then_ switch to the child frame (e.g., the middle frame).\n\nOnce we\'ve done that we\'re able to find the element we need, grab its text, and assert that it\'s what we expect.\n\n## Example 2\n\nHere is a more likely example you\'ll run into -- working with a\n<abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> Editor like [TinyMCE](https://www.tinymce.com/). You can see\nthe page we\'re testing [here](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tinymce).\n\nOnce the page loads we switch into the frame that contains TinyMCE and:\n\n- check the original text\n- input another text\n- check the new text\n\nKeep in mind that if we need to access a part of the page outside the frame we\'re currently in we\'ll need to switch\nto it. Thankfully Selenide has a method that enables us to quickly jump back to the top level of the page\n-- `switchTo().defaultContent()`.\n\n### More methods for frames\n\nSelenide has more methods for working with frames, check:\n* `switchTo().innerFrame()`\n* `switchTo().frame("id", Duration.ofSeconds(6)); // switch with custom timeout`\n\n### Executing the Test\n\nBefore executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `pom.xml` file.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>pom.xml</code> file.</summary>\n    <div>\n        <TipCode codePath={"3-work-with-frames/code/selenide/pom.xml"} language={"xml"}/>\n    </div>\n</details>\n\nFinally, we can run the test by executing `mvn test` from the command-line.\n'},88458:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='import TipCode from "@site/src/components/tipCode";\n\n## TL;DR - Show Me The Code\n\n<TipCode codePath={"3-work-with-frames/code/serenity-js/spec/frames.spec.ts"} language={"ts"}/>\n\n## Code Walkthrough\n\nThis example uses [Serenity/JS](https://serenity-js.org) and [Playwright Test](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test/)\nto demonstrate how to work with frames in a web application.\n\nTo learn more about Serenity/JS, check out:\n- [Web testing with Serenity/JS](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/web-testing/)\n- [Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/)\n- [Serenity/JS Assertions](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/design/assertions/)\n- [Serenity/JS Playwright Test integration](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test/)\n\n### Importing Libraries, Setup and Teardown\n\nFirst, we import the [`describe`](https://serenity-js.org/api/playwright-test/function/describe/)\nand [`it`](https://serenity-js.org/api/playwright-test/function/it/) functions from\n[`@serenity-js/playwright-test`](https://serenity-js.org/api/playwright-test/) - the Serenity/JS adapter for [Playwright Test](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test/).\nWe\'ll use these functions to group and define our test cases, respectively,\nas they offer integration with [Serenity/JS reporters](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/reporting/)\nand test fixtures that allow us to use [Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/)\nlibraries in our test scenarios.\nRelying on [Serenity/JS fixtures](https://serenity-js.org/api/playwright-test/interface/SerenityFixtures/) enables us\nto avoid defining the setup and teardown logic for our tests, as it\'s all done automatically by the test runner.\n\nLater, we import Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern libraries that we\'ll use to interact with the web app\nand perform assertions.\nNote that the [`@serenity-js/web`](https://serenity-js.org/api/web/) module offers an abstraction layer over web integration\ntools like Selenium, Playwright, or WebdriverIO, allowing us to write our tests in a driver-agnostic way and swap out\nthe driver without having to modify the tests.\nFurthermore, the [`@serenity-js/assertions`](https://serenity-js.org/api/assertions/) module provides an universal\nassertion library that enables us to write our assertions using the same syntax regardless of the interface\nour tests interact with - be it web UI, REST API, or anything else.\n\n### Example 1\n\nOur first test scenario is interacting with the [nested frames](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/nested_frames)\nexample from [the-internet](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/nested_frames).\n\nWhile [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/interactions/windows/),\n[WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/webdriver/#switchtoframe),\nand [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-frame) all approach frame switching differently and have their own methods for it,\nSerenity/JS provides a single, consistent API for working with frames, regardless of the underlying driver.\n\nAfterwards, to perform activities in the context of a frame, we use the interaction to [`Switch`](https://serenity-js.org/api/web/class/Switch/) from the\n[`@serenity-js/web`](https://serenity-js.org/api/web/) module, and provide a [`PageElement`](https://serenity-js.org/api/web/class/PageElement/)\nthat represents the frame we want to work with.\nWhen our [`actor`](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/#actors) finishes their last activity in the frame,\nthey\'ll automatically switch their focus back to the parent frame or the top-level page, depending on the context.\nThis way, we can avoid the need to keep track of frames and manually switch back after we\'re done with the nested frame.\n\nIf we need to work with frames nested in other frames, like the middle frame in this example, we repeat the same pattern\nto get to the desired frame, then retrieve the text of the desired element, to then finally perform the assertion.\nWhen the `actor` is done, they\'ll automatically switch their focus back to the top-level frame, and then the top-level page.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA common scenario where you\'ll likely run into frames involves working with\n<abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors, such as [TinyMCE](https://www.tinymce.com/).\n\nOur second test scenario is interacting with the [TinyMCE editor embedded in a nested frame](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/iframe).\nYou\'ll notice that apart from interacting with the frame, this example also demonstrates how to make you `actor`\nuse their [`notes()`](https://serenity-js.org/api/core/class/TakeNotes/) to store and retrieve information about the state of the application under test.\n\nOnce the page loads:\n- We switch into the frame that contains TinyMCE\n- Then, store the original text displayed in the editor and store it in the actor\'s notes\n- Next, use the interaction to [`Clear`](https://serenity-js.org/api/web/class/Clear/) to remove the contents of the editor\n- Afterward, use the interaction to [`Enter`](https://serenity-js.org/api/web/class/Enter/) to enter the new value\n- Finally, use the interaction to [`Ensure`](https://serenity-js.org/api/assertions/class/Ensure/) to assert that the new value is different than what the actor saw originally\n\nWhen the activity sequence from is complete, the actor automatically switches their focus back to the top-level page.\nThis mechanism allows us to go straight to the next step of the scenario without having to worry about the frames,\nand so it ensures that the content of the top-level page heading is as expected.\n\n### Executing the Test\n\nBefore executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `package.json` file.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>package.json</code> file.</summary>\n    <div>\n        <TipCode codePath={"3-work-with-frames/code/serenity-js/package.json"} language={"json"}/>\n    </div>\n</details>\n\nFinally, we can run the test by executing `npm test` from the command-line.\n\n\n\n'},14325:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='using System;\nusing Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;\nusing OpenQA.Selenium;\nusing

Here are some options on how to do that:\n+ make it publicly available (e.g. an asset in a GitHub release)\n+ use [Sauce Labs temporary storage](https://docs.saucelabs.com/mobile-apps/app-storage/)\n+ use [Sauce Connect](https://docs.saucelabs.com/secure-connections/sauce-connect-5/) and grab it from a machine behind your firewall\n\nOnce you have that you just need to set your test's desired capabilities accordingly. You can see a list of \noptions [here](https://docs.saucelabs.com/dev/test-configuration-options/#mobile-appium-capabilities).\n\n## An iPhone Example\n\nIn this example we will be testing an application that has a form that takes 2 numbers, adds them together, and displays the result.\n\n__NOTE: Contrary to the Appium philosophy of not needing to recompile your app, there is one SMALL tweak you'll need \nto make before your app is ready for Sauce (if you care about testing against an iPhone). It's to make sure that \nthe correct simulator gets loaded. Instructions available [here](https://docs.saucelabs.com/mobile-apps/automated-testing/app-files/).__\n\nWe kick off our iPhone example by requiring our dependent libraries (`selenium-webdriver` to drive the browser, \nand `rspec-expectations` for handling assertions). After that, we wire up our setup, teardown, and run methods.\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rspec-expectations'\n\ndef setup\n  caps = {\n    'platform'            => 'Mac 10.8',\n    'version'             => '6.1',\n    'device'              => 'iPhone Simulator',\n    'app'                 => 'https://appium.s3.amazonaws.com/TestApp6.0.app.zip',\n    'name'                => 'Ruby/iPhone Example for Appium'\n  }\n\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for(\n    :remote,\n    :url => \"https://SAUCE_USERNAME:SAUCE_API_KEY@ondemand.saucelabs.com/wd/hub\",\n    :desired_capabilities => caps)\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n```\n\nNote that in `setup` we configure our capabilities by setting them to a hash and storing them in a variable called \n`caps`. In it, we are specifying the platform we would like (`Mac 10.8`), the iOS version (`6.1`), the device \n(`iPhone Simulator`), and the app we would like to load (zipped up and served from AWS).\n\nWe then instantiate Selenium Remote in a `@driver` object; pointing it at Sauce Labs, and passing in our desired \ncapabilities.\n\nAnd in our test we wire up interaction with the app using familiar Selenium WebDriver API actions and an assertion.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n    values = [rand(10), rand(10)]\n    expected_sum = values.reduce(&:+)\n\n    elements = @driver.find_elements(:tag_name, 'textField')\n    elements.each_with_index do |element, index|\n      element.send_keys values[index]\n    end\n\n    @driver.find_element(:tag_name, 'button').click\n    @driver.find_element(:tag_name, 'staticText').text.should == expected_sum.to_s\nend\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n+ Open a job with Sauce Labs\n+ Load an iPhone simulator on a Mac\n+ Load the test app\n+ Input two random numbers\n+ Sum them together\n+ Assert that they are correctly added together\n\n__NOTE: You can see the test result complete with video [here](https://saucelabs.com/tests/6736add27ae544409e7ae918ff74ae8d).__\n\n## An Android Example\n\nIn this example we will be testing a simple note-taking app.\n\nWe kick off our Android example by requiring our dependent libraries (`selenium-webdriver` to drive the browser, \nand `rspec-expectations` for handling assertions). After that, we wire up our setup, teardown, and run methods.\n\n==**`!! Code snippet needs validation !!`**==\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rspec-expectations'\n\ndef setup\n  caps = {\n    'platform'            => 'Linux',\n    'version'             => '4.2',\n    'device'              => 'Android',\n    'app'                 => 'https://appium.s3.amazonaws.com/NotesList.apk',\n    'app-package'         => 'com.example.android.notepad',\n    'app-activity'        => '.NotesList',\n    'name'                => 'Ruby/Android Example for Appium'\n  }\n\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for(\n    :remote,\n    :url => \"http://SAUCE_USERNAME:SAUCE_API_KEY@ondemand.saucelabs.com:80/wd/hub\",\n    :desired_capabilities => caps)\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n```\n\nIn `setup`, we configure our capabilities by setting them to a hash and storing them in a variable called `caps`. In \nit we are specifying the platform (`Linux`), the Android version (`4.2`), the device (`Android`), and where to find \nthe app (zipped and served from AWS). We then instantiate Selenium Remote in a `@driver` object; pointing it at Sauce \nLabs, and passing in our desired capabilities.\n\nThe additional bits of info we need to provide in `caps` (versus in our iPhone example) are `app-package` and \n`app-activity`. `app-package` being the package name of your app, and `app-activity` being the name of the activity \nyou would like to start. `app-activity` gets appended to `app-package` and is used at Sauce run time to launch your \napp (e.g. `com.example.android.notepad.NotesList`).\n\nAnd in our test we wire up interaction with the app using familiar Selenium WebDriver API actions and an assertion.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.find_element(:name, 'New note').click\n  @driver.find_element(:tag_name, 'textfield').send_keys 'This is a new note, from Ruby'\n  @driver.find_element(:name, 'Save').click\n\n  notes = @driver.find_elements(:tag_name, 'text')\n  notes[2].text.should == 'This is a new note, from Ruby'\nend\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n+ Open a job with Sauce Labs\n+ Load an Android simulator on a Linux machine\n+ Load the test app\n+ Create a new note\n+ Fill in the new note\n+ Grab the note text and assert that it's what we inputted\n\n__NOTE: You can see the test result complete with video [here](https://saucelabs.com/tests/e0dbb98af23540d8b43f0806d743fbd8).__\n\n## Other Helpful Tidbits\n\n### Inspecting Elements\n\nIn order to easily inspect and identify the elements in your app, you can use Appium's Inspector which comes \nin [appium-dot-app](https://github.com/appium/appium-dot-app) and requires you to set up Appium locally.\n\n__NOTE: You can see a demo of it in action with an iOS app [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv9A9WfYF4g).__\n\n### Mobile Web Apps\n\nIf instead you have a mobile web app, you can launch mobile Safari by switching out the URL in `app` with `safari`, \nlike so:\n\n```ruby\n  caps = {\n    'platform'            => 'Mac 10.8',\n    'version'             => '6.1',\n    'device'              => 'iPhone Simulator',\n    'app'                 => 'safari',\n    'name'                => 'Ruby/iPhone Example for Appium',\n  }\n```\n\nBut it's worth noting that Sauce Labs does not currently support the ability launch a mobile browser on \nAndroid (e.g. `chrome`). This functionality is, however, available when running Appium locally \n(as documented [here](https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/mobile-web.md#mobile-chrome-on-emulator-or-real-device)).\n\n### Hybrid Apps\n\nIf you have a hybrid mobile app (e.g. an app with a native container that leverages the built in browser engine), \nthen you should be good to go both locally and in Sauce. For details, go [here](https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/hybrid.md).\n\n### Location Services\n\nIf you have an iOS app that deals with geolocation, then working with the Location Services dialog can be a little tricky.\n\nYou can either do a blanket dismiss (which requires some elbow grease -- see \n[this Appium Google Groups thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/appium-discuss/k5gbfVFRPsE/cCkje7tczQcJ) for details), \nor capture and dismiss the dialog as it appears (using functionality found in a library like [ruby_lib](https://github.com/appium/ruby_lib/blob/master/docs/ios_docs.md#alert_click-ios)).\n\nAnd in Sauce Labs, Location Services is disabled by default on iOS 6.1, but enabled by default on iOS 7.1. This is \nnot configurable, but may be in the future through desired capabilities \n(there's [an active thread about this on Sauce's support site](http://support.saucelabs.com/entries/25117411-Location-services-enabled-by-default-on-iOS-devices, feel free to chime in!).\n\n__NOTE: Sauce Labs now supports Location Services (as noted in [this recent support thread comment](http://support.saucelabs.com/entries/25117411#view-post-21941225)). You can set it in your desired capabilities with `locationServicesEnabled` and a `true` or `false` value.__\n\n## Summary\n\nHopefully this tip has helped give you enough to get started with mobile testing. In order to take full advantage of \nwhat Appium has to offer, getting it set up locally is key. I encourage you to check out the installation docs \n(available for [OS X](https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/running-on-osx.md), \n[Linux](https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/running-on-linux.md), \nand [Windows](https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/running-on-windows.md)).\n\nAnd if you're curious about other mobile automation frameworks, Alister Scott \nhas [a good breakdown of them](http://watirmelon.com/2013/11/04/the-current-state-of-ios-automated-functional-testing/).\n\nHappy Testing!\n"},11220:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'How to Test Your Mobile App'\nid: 30-mobile\nslug: /30-mobile\nsidebar_label: Mobile\ndescription: \"Mobile is kind of a big deal.

I've written a more current series of getting started posts for mobile testing\nwith Appium. You can find them [here](https://saucelabs.com/resources/articles/appium-bootcamp-chapter-1).__\n\n## Use Case\n\nMobile is kind of a big deal. And if you haven't needed to test a mobile app yet, it's only a matter of time.\nBut where do you start? And how do you do it in a way that is complimentary to your existing automation and experience?\n\n## A Solution\n\nGive [Appium](https://appium.io/) a try. It's open source, works for both iPhone & Android, and works through the use\nof the Selenium WebDriver API (without having to recompile the app in order to test it).\n\nThat is to say -- you can write tests pretty much the same way as you do now, there are just some additional things\nto think about -- like new functionality (e.g. pinch, swipe, etc.) and setup (e.g. serving your app, running\nsimulators and a server locally, or sending things off to the cloud).\n\nTo simplify things, let's step through 2 examples using Sauce Labs to test native apps -- one for iPhone and\nanother for Android. If you need a primer on what Sauce Labs is and how to use it, check out\n[this tip](https://elementalselenium.com/docs/cloud/26-cloud).\n\n__NOTE: These examples were borrowed from\n[the Appium project](https://github.com/appium/appium/tree/master/sample-code/examples/ruby) and modified for simplicity.__\n\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals.

This is surprising since \nit is [the main reason cited in favor of CSS](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13975595/why-one-should-prefer-using-css-over-xpath-in-ie/14139380#14139380). \nThere may be other functionality or page structures that demonstrates this speed gap (e.g. more dense and \ncomplex pages), but it's not readily apparent -- and I'm skeptical that it would make a substantial impact \n(e.g. the order of magnitude difference demonstrated by [Santi](https://twitter.com/santiycr) in [a presentation at the SF Selenium Meetup back in 2011](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vPu3TO6XZ4)).\n\nTraversing the DOM in older browsers like Internet Explorer 8 does not work with CSS but is fine with XPath. And \nXPath can walk up the DOM (e.g. from child to parent), whereas CSS can only traverse down the DOM (e.g. \nfrom parent to child).\n\nBased on the data, XPath looks more favorable than it once was.\n\n## Some Additional Food For Thought\n\nNot being able to traverse the DOM with CSS in older browsers isn't necessarily a bad thing. To me, it's more of an \nindicator that your page has poor design and could benefit from some helpful markup. I outline an approach \nin [a previous tip](https://elementalselenium.com/docs/how-to-work-with-tables/25-tables) under the heading \n\"But What About Older Browsers?\".\n\nSome other arguments in favor of CSS are that they are more readable, brief, and concise. While I tend to agree, \nit is a subjective call. Sauce Labs has \n[a good set of examples that demonstrate CSS and XPath side-by-side to accomplish both simple and advanced tasks](https://saucelabs.com/resources/blog/selenium-tips-css-selectors). \nIt's worth a look for you to determine for yourself.\n\nIn [Ben Burton](https://twitter.com/bjburton)'s talk ([Selenium WebDriver Best Practices](http://vimeo.com/44133409)) he posits that you \nshould use CSS because that's how applications are built. This makes the tests easier to write, talk about, and have \nothers help maintain. This is also a point that Santi makes in his presentation.\n\n[Adam Goucher](https://twitter.com/adamgoucher)'s advice is to adopt a more hybrid approach -- focusing first on IDs, then CSS, and leveraging \nXPath only when you __need__ it (e.g. walking up the DOM). He says he does this without hesitation because it's \nthe right tool for the task, and that XPath will always be more powerful for advanced locators.\n\n## Summary\n\nSo, which do you choose?\n\nIt's a tough call to make. Especially now that we're armed with the knowledge that the choice is not as reliant \non performance as it once was. But the choice is not as permanent as \n[choosing a programming language](https://elementalselenium.com/docs/adding-a-language/21-choosing-a-language), and \nif you are using helpful abstraction (e.g. [Page Objects](https://elementalselenium.com/docs/use-a-page-object/7-use-a-page-object)) \nthen leveraging a hybrid approach is simple to implement.\n\nIt's just a matter of finding what works for you and your team and not listening to all the hype.\n\nGood luck and Happy Testing!"},49239:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'CSS vs. Xpath'\nid: 32-css-vs-xpath\nslug: /32-css-vs-xpath\nsidebar_label: 'CSS vs. Xpath'\ndescription: \"One of the most heated and subjective conversations in the Selenium community is which locator strategy is better, often circling around two -- XPath and CSS.\"\nnumber: 32\nhide_table_of_contents: true\nlevel: 2\npublish_date: 2014-01-07\ntags:\n  - selectors\n  - xpath\n  - css\n  - css selectors\n  - locators\n  - locator strategy\ncategory:\n  - 'resources'\n---\n\n# CSS vs. XPath\n\n>__NOTE: This is part 1 of 3.

People in favor of CSS say that it is more readable and faster\n(especially when running against Internet Explorer). While those in favor of XPath tout its ability to transverse\nthe page (while CSS cannot).\n\nWith such a divide, it can be hard to determine the best approach for you and your team. Especially when most\nof these claims are outdated.\n\n## A Solution\n\nLet's cut through the noise by running our own performance tests across all major browsers to see how CSS and\nXPath stack up and fall down. Then we will be able to determine a more helpful locator strategy.\n\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals.

This was quick work thanks to the images made available \nby Microsoft. You can grab one [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/).\n\nAfter [installing Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) I installed all available browsers and their equivalent \nbrowser drivers for Selenium use. You can learn more about how to set up different browsers to run locally in \nSelenium [here](https://elementalselenium.com/docs/chrome-driver/29-chrome-driver).\n\nFor benchmarking, I used the library that's available in Ruby's standard lib called 'benchmark'. You can learn more \nabout it [here](https://github.com/ruby/benchmark).\n\nIn order to get an adequate sample set of data, I ran the same test against each browser 100 times. And to weed out \nanomalies in the data I used the rehearsal feature of benchmark so that it would run the full test sequence, perform \ngarbage collection, and then run it again.\n\nTo make things comparable, a few of the locators were updated to make for better matches in comparison to each other. \nAnd the specific action we measured is `find_element`. You can see the locators and test code used \n[here](https://github.com/diemol/selenium-benchmark/blob/master/lib/page-objects/small_dom.rb).\n\nHere are the results.\n\n## The Results\n\n**NOTE: The output is in seconds, and the results are for the total run time of 100 executions.**\n\n[![local browser benchmarks](./../images/local-browser-benchmarks.png)\n\n## What The Results Tell Us\n\nOn a whole, Internet Explorer is slower than the other drivers, but between CSS and XPath it looks like XPath is \nactually **faster** than CSS. Chrome and Opera have some differences, albeit much smaller, but they sway in both \ndirections. In some cases CSS is faster, and in others, XPath. And Firefox looks to be a bit more optimized for \nCSS since it's mostly faster across the board.\n\n**NOTE: Opera 12.16 was used since that is the last supported version within the Selenium project. That's because \nthey switched to using Chromium and dropped Selenium support. That and Mozilla hired Opera's only WebDriver \ndeveloper -- so, there's that.**\n\n## Summary\n\nEven with these speed differences they are only a few seconds (or fractions of seconds) apart -- and that's for \n100 executions. When you think about how it takes 30 seconds or more to complete a test run, this kind of \ndifference is negligible.\n\nAs I noted in [my previous tip](https://elementalselenium.com/docs/css-vs-xpath/32-css-vs-xpath), the choice between \nCSS and XPath can be a tough one to make. But now you are armed with more than enough data to make the choice for \nyourself. It's really just a matter of finding what works for you and your team and to not get weighed down by the \nhype and opinions around which one is better.\n\nHappy Testing!\n\n## About The Author\n\nI'd like to give a huge shout-out to [David Burns](https://twitter.com/AutomatedTester) and [Brian Goad](https://twitter.com/bbbco)!

The unfortunate takeaway from that experiment could be that one driver\nmay be faster than the other (e.g. IE vs Firefox), when in fact, that's not the case at all.\n\n## A Solution\n\nTo get a real taste of what the performance difference is between CSS and XPath, we will need to dig deeper. We'll do\nthat by running everything from a local machine while using a performance benchmarking utility. We'll also want to\nfocus on a specific Selenium action rather than the entire test run, and run things numerous times.\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n"},71647:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="## The Results\n\n### In Table Form\n\n[![benchmark data in an ASCII table](./../images/full-benchmark-data.png)]\n\n### In Chart Form\n\n![chart of chrome](./../images/chart-chrome.png)\n\n![chart of firefox](./../images/chart-firefox.png)\n\n![chart of ie8](./../images/chart-ie8.png)\n\n![chart of ie9](./../images/chart-ie9.png)\n\n![chart of ie10](./../images/chart-ie10.png)\n\n![chart of opera](./../images/chart-opera.png)\n\n## What The Results Tell Us\n\nChrome and Firefox are clearly tuned for faster CSS performance. Internet Explorer 8 is a grab bag of CSS that \nwon't work, an out of control XPath traversal that takes ~65 seconds, and a 38 second table traversal with no CSS \nresult to compare it against.\n\nIn IE 9 and 10, XPath is faster overall. In Safari, it's a toss up, except for a couple of slower traversal runs \nwith XPath. And across almost all browsers, \n[the nested sibling traversal](https://github.com/diemol/selenium-benchmark/blob/master/lib/page-objects/large_dom.rb#L13)\nand [table cell traversal](https://github.com/diemol/selenium-benchmark/blob/master/lib/page-objects/large_dom.rb#L41)\ndone with XPath are an expensive operation.\n\nThat shouldn't be too surprising though since they are brittle and inefficient ways to write locators. Do try to avoid them.\n\n## Summary\n\nSo all in all there are two circumstances where XPath is markedly slower than CSS. But they are easily avoidable. \nOtherwise, the performance difference is slightly in favor of CSS for non-IE browsers and slightly in favor of \nXPath for IE browsers. Given that, I would recommend that you choose your locator strategy based on what works for \nyou and your team. And really, it doesn't matter. If you can ensure that the primary elements on your page have \nunique IDs and Classes then that will always be faster than traversing across the DOM (regardless of which locator \nstrategy you use).\n\nIf you want to do some benchmarking on your own, I wrapped up all the code I wrote into \n[this library](https://github.com/diemol/selenium-benchmark).\n\nHappy Testing!\n\n## About The Author\n\nA huge thanks to [David Burns](https://twitter.com/AutomatedTester), [Brian Goad](https://twitter.com/bbbco), [Dima Kovalenko](https://twitter.com/dimacus), \nand [Simon Stewart](https://twitter.com/shs96c) who provided great feedback and insight into the test and example design.\n"},97349:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'CSS vs. XPath 3'\nid: '34-css-vs-xpath-3'\nslug: /34-css-vs-xpath-3\nsidebar_label: 'CSS vs. Xpath 3'\ndescription: \"In the last tip I provided benchmarks that showed XPath and CSS performance across various browsers.

If you're struggling with an issue and need help with a solution, access to these resources and\ncommunities can be especially essential.\n\n## A Solution\n\nHere is a comprehensive list showing many of the Selenium resources available and what they are useful for.\n\n## Available Resources\n\n### Documentation & Tips\n\n+ [Selenium Documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/)\n\nThis is the official Selenium documentation site. There is a lot of helpful information here. Use the sidebar\nmenu on the left to navigate. Each documentation article is dated at the bottom to show when it was last modified,\nand the site seems to be kept fairly updated.\n\n+ [The Selenium Wiki](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/wiki)\n\nThere is a lot of great stuff in this wiki -- mainly, documentation about the various language bindings and browser\ndrivers. If you're not already familiar with it, take a look. It is kept very up-to-date by volunteer contributors\nwho have donated thousands of hours in upkeep and code development.\n\n+ [Hands-On Selenium WebDriver with Java - The Repo](https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-webdriver-java)\n\nThis is an open-source project created and maintained by [Boni Garcia](https://twitter.com/boni_gg). It contains a comprehensive collection\nof examples about Selenium 4 using Java as language binding. These examples are explained in Boni's book mentioned\nbelow in the Books section.\n\n### Books\n\n+ [Hands-On Selenium WebDriver with Java - The Book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-selenium-webdriver/9781098109998/)\n\nThis book is by [Boni Garcia](https://twitter.com/boni_gg), and it is a thorough resource. It outlines how to use Selenium, top-to-bottom,\nusing Java, and is a great resource to keep handy.\n\n### Meetups\n\n+ [All Selenium Meetups listed on Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/find/?keywords=selenium&source=EVENTS)\n\nA listing of all in-person Selenium Meetups are available on Meetup.com. If you're near a major city, odds are\nthere's one waiting for you.\n\n### Conferences\n\n+ [Selenium Conf](https://seleniumconf.com/)\n\nThis is the annual conference where practitioners and Selenium Core Committers gather and share knowledge. All talks are top notch, as is the hallway track. If I were to attend just one conference a year, it would be this one.\n\n+ [Selenium Camp](https://seleniumcamp.com/)\n\nThis is a self-organized Selenium conference that's held annually in Kiev, Ukraine. It's a well organized event\nwith some great talks. It's the most advanced test automation conference I've attended. Definitely worth the trip.\n\n### Videos\n\n+ [Selenium Conference Talks](http://www.youtube.com/user/seleniumconf/videos)\n\nEvery year talks from The Selenium Conference are recorded and made freely available online. This is one of the\nbest resources around.\n\n+ [Selenium Meetup Talks](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL67l1VPxOnT4BwuKRmt_INeMd0_jtUhDt)\n\nSome Selenium Meetups take it upon themselves to record their talks and publish them afterwards. Here are some of\nthem. They are a great way to see what other pockets of the community are up to (outside the annual Selenium Conf).\n\n### Mailing Lists\n\n+ [Selenium Users Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/selenium-users)\n+ [Selenium LinkedIn Users Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/961927/)\n\nThese groups are fairly large, and it can be challenging at times to find what you're looking for. Even so, you can\noccasionally find some unique insights and answers to your questions.\n\n### Forums\n\n+ [Quora](http://www.quora.com/Selenium-testing-framework)\n+ [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/)\n+ [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/selenium)\n\nThese are amazing community forums where you can go look for answers to questions you have regarding Selenium.\nThe forums are populated by community members who volunteer their time and expertise to answer questions and help\ntroubleshoot towards solutions.\n\n### Issues\n\n+ [Selenium Issue Tracker](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/issues)\n\nIf you're running into a specific and repeatable issue that just doesn't make sense, you may have found a bug in\nSelenium. You'll want to check the Selenium Issue Tracker to see if it has already been reported. If not, then create\na new issue. But be sure to read [this post](http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2012/12/not-providing-html-page-is-bogus.html) before you do (so you can be sure that you've provided enough\ninformation for the Core Committers to work on it).\n\n## Summary\n\nAs you can see there's a lot out there. But hopefully this list has helped guide you to the best resources for\nyour context.\n\nHappy Testing!\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's\nread by thousands of testing professionals. He also created and maintains the-internet (an open-source web app\nthat's perfect for writing automated tests against).\n\nDave has helped numerous companies successfully implement automated acceptance testing; including The Motley\nFool, ManTech International, Sittercity, and Animoto. He is also an active member of the Selenium project and has\nspoken at numerous conferences and meetups around the world about automated acceptance testing.\n"},795:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="## Example\n\nBefore we can use Xvfb, we need to install it (along with the browser we want if it's not already loaded).\n\nIn Linux we need to find the relevant package names for the package manager and install them \n(e.g., `apt-get install xvfb firefox` for Debian based systems like Ubuntu, `yum install Xvfb firefox` for \nRedHat based systems, etc.).\n\nNow let's create a simple Selenium script.\n\n```ruby\n# filename: headless.rb\n\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rspec/expectations'\ninclude RSpec::Matchers\n\ndef setup\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'https://the-internet.herokuapp.com'\n  expect(@driver.title).to eql 'The Internet'\n  @driver.save_screenshot 'headless.png'\nend\n```\n\nHere we are loading a page, asserting the title (to make sure we're in the right place), and grabbing a screenshot \n(so we can make sure our Xvfb setup is working). The screenshot will render in the directory alongside the test script.\n\nNext we need to setup Xvfb, and we have a few options.\n\n### Option 1\n\n+ Start Xvfb on a specific display port and background the process\n+ Tell the terminal session to use the display port\n+ Run the test\n\n```sh\nXvfb :99 &\nexport DISPLAY=:99\nruby headless.rb\n```\n\n__NOTE: This approach will keep Xvfb running in the background until the process is killed.__\n\n### Option 2\n\n+ Use `xvfb-run` to launch the tests (no display port declaration necessary)\n\n```sh\nxvfb-run ruby headless.rb\n```\n\n__NOTE: This approach will start and stop Xvfb for you.__\n\n### Option 3\n\n+ Install [the headless gem](https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/headless)\n+ Update the test `setup` and `teardown` to use it\n+ Run the test\n\n```ruby\n# filename: headless2.rb\n\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rspec/expectations'\nrequire 'headless'\n\ndef setup\n  @headless = Headless.new\n  @headless.start\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\n  @headless.destroy\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'https://the-internet.herokuapp.com'\n  expect(@driver.title).to eql 'The Internet'\n  @driver.save_screenshot 'headless2.png'\nend\n```\n\nIn `setup` we are creating an instance of the headless library and issuing a `.start` command (which starts Xvfb). \nIn `teardown` we stop Xvfb by with the `.destroy` after closing the browser with `@driver.quit`. The only thing \nthat changed in our `run` action is the name of the screenshot (from `headless.png` to `headless2.png`).\n\nWith the library in place, running the test (e.g., `ruby headless2.rb`) will automatically run it headless -- \nstarting and stopping Xvfb for us.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen we save either file and run it (e.g., `ruby headless.rb` or `ruby headless2.rb` from the command-line) here is \nwhat will happen:\n\n+ Xvfb starts\n+ Browser opens in a virtual framebuffer\n+ Test runs and captures a screenshot from the browser\n+ Browser closes\n+ Xvfb terminates (unless using Option 1)\n\n## Choosing The Best Option\n\nThe headless gem is a handy resource. But if you use it, you'll want to make its use configurable, so it does not load \nevery time. This will be helpful when running your tests in non-Linux environments.\n\nIf you're just looking to try out headless testing, and you're unsure of how much time you want to invest, then using \nthe Xvfb application (e.g., options 1 or 2) is a sound path since you won't need to update your test code to use it.\n\n## Running Concurrent Builds\n\nIf you're running tests headless across different builds at the same time (e.g., in parallel) on your CI server, \nthen jobs will start to break unexpectedly. This is because of a display port collision with Xvfb (e.g., two or more \nXvfb sessions trying to run on the same display port at the same time).\n\nWhen this happens you can issue a runtime flag when launching `xvfb-run` that will keep trying display ports \nuntil it finds a free one (e.g., `xvfb-run -a`). You can read more about it in the man page [here](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/xvfb-run.1.html).\n\nAlternatively you can use the CI build number as your Xvfb display port. This way each display port is unique. \nEach CI server is different, but you should have access to this value somehow. For example, this is made available \nthrough an environment variable in Jenkins.\n\n## Summary\n\nHopefully this tip has helped you get your tests running smoothly on your CI Server.

It enables you to run graphical applications without a display\n> (e.g., browser tests on a CI server) while also having the ability to take screenshots.\n\nLet's take a look at an example.\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n\n\n\n"},40757:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="## Example\n\nYou can see a simple HTML5 drag and drop example [here on the-internet](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/drag_and_drop).\n\nFirst, let's borrow [the JavaScript made available by rcorreia on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/rcorreia/2362544) for this workaround and store it in a local file (e.g., `dnd.js`).\n\nNow we can create a Selenium script to consume the JavaScript file, visit the page, execute the JavaScript, and perform an assertion.\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rspec/expectations'\ninclude RSpec::Matchers\n\ndef setup\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n```\n\nAfter including our dependent libraries, we wire up our `setup`, `teardown`, and `run` actions. Now we're ready to write our test.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.get \"http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/drag_and_drop\"\n\n  dnd_javascript = File.read(Dir.pwd + '/dnd.js')\n  @driver.execute_script(dnd_javascript+\"$('#column-a').simulateDragDrop({ dropTarget: '#column-b'});\")\n\n  expect(@driver.find_element(id: 'column-a').text).to eql('B')\n  expect(@driver.find_element(id: 'column-b').text).to eql('A')\n\nend\n```\n\nAfter loading the page we read in the `dnd.js` file and store it in a local variable. We then use Selenium to execute `dnd_javascript` along with the function calls and elements we want to work with. After that, it's just a simple matter of grabbing text from the page and making an assertion against it.\n\nSince there are only two elements to drag and drop on the page, they should have switched places. So, `column-a` should now contain the text 'B', and `column-b` should contain the text 'A'.\n\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen you run the ruby file, here is what will happen:\n\n+ Open the browser\n+ Visit the page\n+ Text in Column A and Column B will switches places\n+ Close the browser\n\n## Summary\n\nHopefully this tip has helped you figure out how to wrangle HTML5 dragging and dropping while there is a known bug for it in Selenium.\n\nHappy Testing!\n"},12815:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'How to Test HTML5 Drag and Drop'\nid: '39-drag-and-drop'\nslug: /39-drag-and-drop\nsidebar_label: How to Test HTML5 Drag and Drop\ndescription: \"Exercising a page's drag-and-drop functionality used to be simple with Selenium's Action Builder, but sadly, it won't work with HTML5 drag and drop.\"\nnumber: 39\nhide_table_of_contents: true\nlevel: 2\npublish_date: 2014-02-25\ntags:\n  - 'drag and drop'\n  - 'DnD'\n  - 'javascript'\n  - 'bug'\ncategory:\n  - 'remote'\n---\n\n# How to Test HTML5 Drag and Drop\n\n## Intro\n\nExercising a page's drag-and-drop functionality used to be simple with [Selenium's Action Builder](http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/ActionBuilder.html), but sadly,\n[it won't work with HTML5 drag and drop](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=6315).\n\n## A Solution\n\nAs a workaround, we can simulate dragging and dropping by executing JavaScript with Selenium.

Each time checking the page title to make sure\nthe correct window is in focus.\n\nFor more information about switching windows (and tabs) visit the official Selenium\n[documentation page](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/interactions/windows/).\n\n### Executing the Test\n\nBefore executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `Gemfile` file.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>Gemfile</code> file.</summary>\n    <div>\n        <TipCode codePath={"4-work-with-multiple-windows/code/ruby/Gemfile"} language={"txt"}/>\n    </div>\n</details>\n\nFinally, we can run the test by executing `ruby windows.rb` from the command-line.'},53393:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='import TipCode from "@site/src/components/tipCode";\n\n## TL;DR - Show Me The Code\n\n<TipCode\n    codePath={"4-work-with-multiple-windows/code/selenide/src/test/java/com/elemental/selenium/MultipleWindowsTest.java"}\n    language={"java"}/>\n\n## Code Walkthrough\n\n### Importing Libraries, Setup and Teardown\n\nFirst let\'s import our requisite classes\n * for annotations (e.g., `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test`),\n * opening the browser with Selenide (e.g., `com.codeborne.selenide.Selenide.open`),\n * matchers for assertions (e.g., `com.codeborne.selenide.Condition.text`)\n\nIn the following lines we start our class off with some setup.\n\n### The test\n\nThe `multipleWindows` test exercises new window functionality from an application. In this case, we\'ll be using\n[the new window example](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/windows) from [the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet).\n\nAfter loading the page we click the link with text "Click Here" which spawns a new window.\n\nWe then switch between windows based on their order (assuming that the first one is the originating window, and\nthe second one is the new window). We round this test out by performing a simple check against the title of\nthe page to make sure Selenide is focused on the correct window.\n\n### Details\n\n* A pre-condition is checked: the browser has only one window before we start any actions\n* Click the link "Click Here"\n* Check that now the browser has 2 windows\n* Check that the active window is still the first one (we check its title and url)\n* Switch to the "new" window (index 0 for the original window, index 1 for the new window)\n* Check that the active window is the new one (we check its title and url)\n\n### Executing the Test\n\nBefore executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `pom.xml` file.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>pom.xml</code> file.</summary>\n    <div>\n        <TipCode codePath={"4-work-with-multiple-windows/code/selenide/pom.xml"} language={"xml"}/>\n    </div>\n</details>\n\nFinally, we can run the test by executing `mvn test` from the command-line.'},30269:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='using System;\nusing Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;\nusing

Multiple Windows\n\n## The Problem\n\nThis tip will explain how to work with multiple windows in Selenium and switch between them.\n\nOccasionally you\'ll run into a link or action in the application you\'re testing that will open a new window. In order\nto work with both the new and originating windows you\'ll need to switch between them.\n\nOn the face of it, this is a pretty straightforward concept. But there may be a small challenge to watch out for\nthat you may find in some browsers and not others.\n\nLet\'s step through a couple of examples to demonstrate.\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from \'@site/src/components/displayTips\';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: \'Python\', value: \'python\'},\n    {label: \'C#\', value: \'csharp\'},\n    {label: \'Java\', value: \'java\'},\n    {label: \'JavaScript\', value: \'javascript\'},\n    {label: \'Ruby\', value: \'ruby\'},\n    {label: \'Selenide\', value: \'selenide\'},\n]}/>\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n- Open the browser\n- Visit the page\n- Click to open a new window\n- Switch between the windows\n- Check the page title to make sure the correct window is in focus\n- Close the browser\n\n## Outro\n\nWe hope this was a helpful guide on how to work with and switch between multiple windows.\n\nHappy Testing!\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nimport DefaultAvatar from "@site/src/components/defaultAvatar";\n\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Jim Evans"\n    imgSrc={"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1187184424/Jim_Evans_casual_small_400x400.jpg"}\n    description={"Provided the info for this tip."}\n    url={"https://twitter.com/jimevansmusic"}\n/>\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Roman Isko"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/sturman.png"}\n    description={"Contributed the initial Java code for this tip."}\n    url={"https://github.com/sturman"}\n/>\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Mike Millgate"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/trabulmonkee.png"}\n    description={"Contributed the Python code for this tip."}\n    url={"https://github.com/trabulmonkee"}\n/>\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Isaul Vargas"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/isaulv.png"}\n    description={"Python code review"}\n    url={"https://github.com/isaulv"}\n/>\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Peter Bittner"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/bittner.png"}\n    description={"Python code review"}\n    url={"https://github.com/bittner"}\n/>\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Jonathan Taylor"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/jtay2380.png"}\n    description={"Contributed the initial C# code for this tip."}\n    url={"https://github.com/jtay2380"}\n/>\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Andrei Solntsev"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/asolntsev.png"}\n    description={"Contributed the Selenide code for this tip."}\n    url={"https://github.com/asolntsev"}\n/>\n\n## Authors\n\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Dave Piacente"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/tourdedave.png"}\n    description={"Original creator of Elemental Selenium"}\n    url={"https://github.com/tourdedave"}\n    author={true}\n/>\n\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name="Diego Molina"\n    imgSrc={"https://github.com/diemol.png"}\n    description={"Current maintainer of Elemental Selenium"}\n    url={"https://github.com/diemol"}\n    author={true}\n/>'},38495:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='## Example\n\nFor this example we will use [the dropdown list](http://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet) from [the-internet](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dropdown). In this list there a few options to select, one which should be disabled. Let\'s find this element and assert that it is in fact disabled.\n\nLet\'s start by including our requisite classes for our test framework (e.g., `NUnit.Framework`), driving the browser with Selenium (e.g., `OpenQA.Selenium`, etc.), and start our class off with some setup and teardown methods.\n\n```csharp\n// filename: DisabledElements.cs\nusing NUnit.Framework;\nusing OpenQA.Selenium;\nusing OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox;\nusing OpenQA.Selenium.Support.UI;\n\npublic class DisabledElements\n{\n    IWebDriver Driver;\n\n    [SetUp]\n    public void SetUp()\n    {\n        Driver = new FirefoxDriver();\n    }\n\n    [TearDown]\n    public void TearDown()\n    {\n        Driver.Quit();\n    }\n// ...\n```\n\nNow to wire up our test.\n\n```csharp\n// filename: DisabledElements.cs\n// ...\n    [Test]\n    public void ElementDisabled()\n    {\n        Driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dropdown");\n        var Dropdown = new SelectElement(Driver.FindElement(By.Id("dropdown")));\n        // The SelectedOption we want is selected by default on page load\n        Assert.False(Dropdown.SelectedOption.Enabled);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAfter visiting the page we find the dropdown list with the `SelectElement` function and store it in a variable. We then use in our assertion, focusing on the currently selected option which is the first one by default on page load (e.g., `Dropdown.SelectedOption`) and check that it is enabled (e.g., `.Enabled`). This will return a boolean result. If the element is disabled (e.g., not selectable) then Selenium will return `false`. So that\'s what we use in our assertion (e.g., `Assert.False`).\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen you save this file and run it (e.g., `nunit3-console.exe .\\DisabledElements.sln` from the command-line) here is what will happen:\n\n- Open a browser\n- Visit the page\n- Grab the dropdown list\n- Assert that the target element is not enabled\n- Close the browser\n\n## Summary\n\nHopefully this tip has helped make the task of seeing whether an element is enabled or disabled more approachable.\n\nHappy Testing!\n'},34518:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="## Example\n\nFor this example we will use [the dropdown list](http://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet) from [the-internet](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dropdown).

Let's find this element and assert that it is disabled.\n\nLet's start by importing our requisite classes (for annotations (e.g., `org.junit.After`, etc.), driving the browser with Selenium (e.g., `org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver`, etc.), and matchers for our assertions (e.g., `org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers`, etc.)) and start our class with some setup and teardown methods.\n\n```java\n// filename: DisabledElements.java\nimport org.junit.After;\nimport org.junit.Before;\nimport org.junit.Test;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.By;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.Select;\nimport static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.*;\nimport static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;\n\npublic class DisabledElements {\n    WebDriver driver;\n\n    @Before\n    public void setUp() throws Exception {\n        driver = new FirefoxDriver();\n\n    }\n\n    @After\n    public void tearDown() throws Exception {\n        driver.quit();\n    }\n// ...\n```\n\nNow to wire up our test.\n\n```java\n// filename: DisabledElements.java\n// ...\n    @Test\n    public void test() {\n        driver.get(\"http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dropdown\");\n        Select dropdown = new Select(driver.findElement(By.id(\"dropdown\")));\n        assertThat(dropdown.getOptions().get(0).isEnabled(), is(false));\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nAfter visiting the page we find the dropdown list with the `Select` function and store it in a variable.

The best candidates are \nthread local variables. They have a global scope (similar to global variables) but are only accessible from within \nthe thread that created it. This way we won't run into any odd collisions across simultaneous test runs.\n\nSo instead of instance variables (e.g., `@driver`) we are now storing each instance of Selenium in this new kind of \nvariable and referencing it as needed (e.g., `Thread.current[:driver]`).\n\n```ruby\n# filename: example42.rb\n\nBROWSERS = { firefox: '27',\n             chrome: '32',\n             internet_explorer: '8' }\n\ndef run\n  threads = []\n  BROWSERS.each_pair do |browser, browser_version|\n    threads << Thread.new do\n      setup(browser, browser_version)\n      yield\n      teardown\n    end\n  end\n  threads.each { |thread| thread.join }\nend\n```\n\nOur browser list remains untouched, but our `run` method has been updated to spawn and join threads (which is how \nyou finish a thread). With this setup a new thread will be spawned for each of the browsers in the list, perform \nits actions, and finish.\n\nWill all of that in place, we just need to update our test to use the new thread local driver variable.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  Thread.current[:driver].get 'https://the-internet.herokuapp.com'\n  Thread.current[:driver].title.should == 'The Internet'\nend\n```\n\nIf we run this script from the command line (`ruby examle42.rb`) and head over \n[the Sauce Labs Account page](https://saucelabs.com/account), then we should see three tests running simultaneously.\n\nNOTE: the number of parallel sessions allotted to your Sauce Labs account will dictate how quickly your tests will \nfinish. For instance, if you add two new browsers to `BROWSER_LIST` and run this, only 3 sessions will run in Sauce \nLabs, queuing the other two until some of the original sessions finish.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n+ Simultaneously loads each browser in a Sauce Labs job\n+ Each test loads the page and asserts the title is correct\n+ Each session closes when it is complete\n\n## Summary\n\nThere are alternative ways to run your tests in parallel.

But since we're dealing with a third-party \nprovider we'll want to build in some resiliency. So let's create a simple mechanism to retry our email lookup a \nconfigurable number of times and make it wait a handful of seconds in-between each attempt.\n\n```ruby\ndef try(number_of_times)\n  count = 0 ; item_of_interest = nil\n  until item_of_interest != nil || count == number_of_times\n    item_of_interest = yield\n    sleep 10\n    count += 1\n  end\nend\n```\n\nWhen calling this method, we will need to specify an integer for the number of times that we'd like to retry an \naction. And we'll specify the action by passing it to the method through the use of `yield` (which enables us to \npass a block of code into the method just like we're doing for the `run` method). Between each attempt, the \nmethod will wait for `10` seconds.\n\nNow let's wire up our test.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/forgot_password'\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'email').send_keys(ENV['EMAIL_USERNAME'])\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'form_submit').click\n\n  gmail = Gmail.new(ENV['EMAIL_USERNAME'], ENV['EMAIL_PASSWORD'])\n  try(6) { @email = gmail.inbox.emails(:unread, from: 'no-reply@the-internet.herokuapp.com').last }\n  message_body = @email.message.body.raw_source\n\n  url =  message_body.scan(/https?:\\/\\/[\\S]+/).last\n  username = message_body.scan(/username: (.*)$/)[0][0].strip\n  password = message_body.scan(/password: (.*)$/)[0][0].strip\n\n  @driver.get url\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'username').send_keys username\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'password').send_keys password\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'login').submit\n  expect(@driver.current_url.include?('/secure')).to eql true\nend\n```\n\nWe initiate the forgot password workflow by loading the page with the forgot password form, providing an email \naddress, and submitting the form. We then access the Gmail account headless. Notice that the username and password \ncredentials are specified with environment variables, but you could just as easily hard-code your credentials here.\n\nAfter connecting we attempt to retrieve the message body. Here is where we employ our `try` method (retrying the \nlookup action up to `6` times). If the inbox lookup doesn't find what it's looking for, it will return `nil`, \nwhich will trigger the `try` loop to run again after waiting `10` seconds. If it finds what we're looking for, \nthen the loop will stop running and the test will proceed.\n\nOnce the forgot password email is found we parse it's body with regular expressions to find the URL & user \ncredentials in it. We then put these values to use with our browser session (which is still active) by visiting\nthe URL and logging in. Once done we assert that login was successful by checking to see if we gained access to a \nsecure part of the site.\n\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nIf you save this file and run it (e.g., `ruby forgot_password.rb` from the command-line) here is what will happen:\n\n+ Open the browser\n+ Visit the page and initiate the forgot password workflow\n+ Headless access Gmail and retrieve the email message body\n+ Parse the message body for user credentials\n+ Visit the site and login with the user credentials\n+ Check that login was successful\n+ Close the browser\n\n__NOTE: When running this script you can pass in the Gmail account username and password at runtime \n(e.g., `EMAIL_USERNAME=youremail@gmail.com EMAIL_PASSWORD=yourpassword ruby forgot_password.rb`).__\n\n## Summary\n\nYour forgot password workflow might be different, so adapt as needed.

After logging in, we'll check to see that the login form is no longer displayed.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login'\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'username').send_keys('tomsmith')\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'password').send_keys('SuperSecretPassword!')\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'login').submit\n  wait_for(10) { @driver.find_element(css: '.icon-2x').displayed? }\n  expect(@driver.find_element(id: 'login').displayed?).to eql false\nend\n```\n\nWhen we run this (e.g., `ruby exception_handling.rb` from the command-line) our test will not pass. It will log in just fine, but it will error when performing the assertion -- returning the following exception:\n\n```text\nUnable to locate element: {\"method\":\"id\",\"selector\":\"login\"} (Selenium::WebDriver::Error::NoSuchElementError)\n```\n\nIn the Python Selenium bindings they have a section of actions called [expected conditions](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/py/webdriver_support/selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions.html). One of them is designed specifically for this use case (called `visibility_of_element_located`). It checks to see if an element is displayed and returns `false` if it's not (rather than throwing an exception).\n\nUnfortunately the Ruby Selenium bindings do not come with this functionality built-in, and there are no plans to add it. So let's go through how to do it ourselves. For that we'll need a basic understanding of exceptions and how to rescue them ([here's a quick primer](https://skorks.com/2009/09/ruby-exceptions-and-exception-handling/)) and the name of the exception we want to rescue. You can find a full list of the Selenium exceptions for Ruby [here](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/Error.html). But we shouldn't need all of them since our previous test run told us the name of the exception.\n\n`Selenium::WebDriver::Error::NoSuchElementError` is the one we want. Let's put it to use by wrapping the last display check in our test with a `rescue` block, making it return `false` if it's triggered.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login'\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'username').send_keys('tomsmith')\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'password').send_keys('SuperSecretPassword!')\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'login').submit\n  begin\n    expect(@driver.find_element(id: 'login').displayed?).to eql false\n  rescue Selenium::WebDriver::Error::NoSuchElementError\n    false\n  rescue Selenium::WebDriver::Error::StaleElementReferenceError\n    false\n  end\nend\n```\n\nNow if we run the test (e.g., `ruby exception_handling.rb` from the command-line) it will pass. But this is far from a clean implementation. Let's clean things up a bit.\n\n```ruby\ndef rescue_exceptions\n  begin\n    yield\n  rescue Selenium::WebDriver::Error::NoSuchElementError\n    false\n  rescue Selenium::WebDriver::Error::StaleElementReferenceError\n    false\n  end\nend\n\ndef is_displayed?(locator = {})\n  rescue_exceptions { @driver.find_element(locator).displayed? }\nend\n\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login'\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'username').send_keys('tomsmith')\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'password').send_keys('SuperSecretPassword!')\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'login').submit\n  expect(is_displayed?(id: 'login')).to eql false\nend\n```\n\nBy breaking apart our rescue block (into a `rescue_exceptions` method) and our `displayed?` check (into an `is_displayed?` method) we're left with a cleaner (and reusable) implementation in our test code. And if you wanted to add another Selenium exception to the mix, then you would simply add a new `rescue` statement along with the result you want in `rescue_exceptions`.\n\n```ruby\ndef rescue_exceptions\n  begin\n    yield\n  rescue Selenium::WebDriver::Error::NoSuchElementError\n    false\n  rescue Selenium::WebDriver::Error::StaleElementReferenceError\n    false\n  end\nend\n```\n\n__NOTE: `NoSuchElementError` and `StaleElementReferenceError` are the two most common errors you'll run into when using Selenium.__\n\n## Example 2\n\nIf your test is still failing, it might not have enough time to find the `login` element. In this case, you will have to add a `wait` to your test.\n\n```ruby\n# exception-with-wait.rb\n\ndef wait_for(seconds)\n  Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(timeout: seconds).until { yield }\nend\n```\n\nAlso add this line to your run code, just before the `expect` line:\n\n```ruby\n# exception-with-wait.rb\n\nwait_for(10) { @driver.find_element(css: '.icon-2x').displayed? }\n```\n\n__The full script with `wait` added will be as follows:__\n\n```ruby\n# exception-with-wait.rb\n\n# filename: exception_handling.rb\n\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rspec/expectations'\ninclude RSpec::Matchers\n\ndef setup\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n\ndef rescue_exceptions\n  begin\n    yield\n  rescue Selenium::WebDriver::Error::NoSuchElementError\n    false\n  rescue Selenium::WebDriver::Error::StaleElementReferenceError\n    false\n  end\nend\n\ndef is_displayed?(locator = {})\n  rescue_exceptions { @driver.find_element(locator).displayed? }\nend\n\ndef wait_for(seconds)\n  Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(timeout: seconds).until { yield }\nend\n\n\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login'\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'username').send_keys('tomsmith')\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'password').send_keys('SuperSecretPassword!')\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'login').submit\n  wait_for(10) { @driver.find_element(css: '.icon-2x').displayed? }\n  expect(is_displayed?(id: 'login')).to eql false\nend\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nIf you save the file and run it (e.g, `ruby exception_handling.rb` from the command-line) here is what will happen:\n\n+ Open the browser\n+ Visit the page\n+ Log in\n+ Check to see that the login form is NOT displayed\n+ Catch the exception from Selenium and return `false` instead\n+ Complete the assertion using the boolean response (e.g., `false`)\n+ Close the browser\n\n## Summary\n\nHopefully this tip has helped you learn how to work effectively with exceptions in Selenium.\n\nHappy Testing!\n"},31194:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'How To Handle Exceptions'\nid: '44-exception-handling'\nsidebar_label: How To Handle Exceptions\nslug: /44-exception-handling\ndescription: \"It doesn't take long when using Selenium before you run into errors from Selenium that may seem inexplicable .

There are two examples, each is constructed slightly differently, but they have the same behavior (e.g., when you click the button on the page a loading bar appears for 5 seconds then disappears and displays some text).\n\nFirst let's pull in our dependent libraries (e.g., `selenium-webdriver` to drive the browser, and `rspec/expectations` and `RSpec::Matchers` for our assertions) and wire up some simple methods (e.g., `setup`, `teardown`, and `run`) to handle our test configuration.\n\n```ruby\n# filename: waiting.rb\n\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rspec/expectations'\ninclude RSpec::Matchers\n\ndef setup\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox\n  @driver.manage.timeouts.implicit_wait = 3\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n```\n\nNotice that in `setup` we are specifying an implicit wait of `3` seconds. This tells Selenium to retry each `find_element` action for up to 3 seconds. If it can complete the action in that amount of time, it will proceed onto the next command. Otherwise, it will raise a timeout exception.\n\nNow let's add our first test.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/1'\n  @driver.find_element(css: '#start button').click\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'finish').displayed?\n  expect(@driver.find_element(id: 'finish').text).to eql('Hello World!')\nend\n```\n\nIn this example the element we're interested in is already on the page, just hidden. When we execute this (e.g., `ruby waiting.rb` from the command-line) the `.displayed?` step runs, but it doesn't trigger the implicit wait. Instead, the test proceeds directly to the assertion looking for text that's not there and failing.\n\nLet's run the same test against the other dynamic loading example.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/2'\n  @driver.find_element(css: '#start button').click\n  @driver.find_element(id: 'finish').displayed?\n  expect(@driver.find_element(id: 'finish').text).to eql('Hello World!')\nend\n```\n\nIn this example the element we're interested in gets rendered _after_ the loading bar. When we run this (e.g., `ruby waiting.rb` from the command-line) the `.displayed?` step will wait as we intend, but the assertion will still fail. That's because the implicit wait is not long enough (because the loading bar takes 5 seconds to complete, but the implicit wait is set at `3` seconds).\n\nNow we're at a cross-roads. Do we increase the implicit wait to account for this? That would be a simple enough fix for this example. But that's a bad option since it would impact _all_ tests that use this setup. Instead, we can use an explicit wait.\n\n```ruby\ndef wait_for(seconds)\n  Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(timeout: seconds).until { yield }\nend\n\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/2'\n  @driver.find_element(css: '#start button').click\n  wait_for(10) { @driver.find_element(id: 'finish').displayed? }\n  expect(@driver.find_element(id: 'finish').text).to eql('Hello World!')\nend\n```\n\nIf we wrap our `.displayed?` action in an explicit wait we are able to override the implicit wait and wait for up 10 seconds. Now when we run our test, our test will pass. And if we revisit our first example and do the same, then it will pass too.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/1'\n  @driver.find_element(css: '#start button').click\n  wait_for(10) { @driver.find_element(id: 'finish').displayed? }\n  expect(@driver.find_element(id: 'finish').text).to eql('Hello World!')\nend\n```\n\n>### On Not Mixing Explicit and Implicit WaitsIf your test suite uses both explicit and implicit waits, then you're in for some pain (e.g., transient failures as you scale your test suite). For more details about this, check out [this StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15164742/combining-implicit-wait-and-explicit-wait-together-results-in-unexpected-wait-ti#answer-15174978) from [Jim Evans](https://twitter.com/jimevansmusic) (a member of the Selenium core team).The best thing is to only use explicit waits. We already have them in place, so we can go ahead and simply remove the implicit wait from our `setup` method.```rubydef setup  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefoxend\n>```And there you go!## Expected Behavior\n\nIf we save the file and run it (e.g., `ruby waiting.rb` from the command-line) here is what will happen:\n\n+ Open the browser\n+ Visit the page\n+ Click the Start button\n+ Wait for the progress bar to disappear and finish text to appear\n+ Assert that the finish text appears on the page\n+ Close the browser\n\n## Summary\n\nWhile an implicit wait can be useful, providing you an initial blanket of cover, it's not ideal for every circumstance. Instead, explicit waits are a better tool for the job since they provide more resilient and predictable results (even if they make your test code more verbose).\n\nRegardless of the approach you choose, be sure never to mix implicit and explicit waits together.\n\nHappy Testing!"},56661:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'Implicit vs Explicit Waits'\nid: 47-waiting\nslug: /47-waiting\nsidebar_label: Implicit vs Explicit Waits\ndescription: \"In order to make our Selenium tests resilient, we need to make them wait for certain elements to load.

Elements that we want to interact with. This is especially true with JavaScript heavy pages.\n\nBut should we be using static sleeps, implicit waits, explicit waits?\n\nStatic sleeps are something to be avoided, because they force your tests to wait a _hard-coded_ amount of time to perform an action -- this is not recommended. But what about implicit waits, explicit waits... and what about using them together?\n\n## A Solution\n\nThe short answer? Use explicit waits.\n\nAdding an implicit wait to your Selenium tests is simple enough and may seem intuitive. But there are cases where it\nsimply doesn't help you like you think it will. And while you can combine explicit and implicit waits together\n(e.g., override an implicit wait with an explicit wait to make a Selenium action wait longer) -- you shouldn't.\nI'll discuss more on that later.\n\nLet's continue with some examples.\n\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals.

For easier debugging later, we will want to add some error handling to output the results from each HTTP request that's replayed (`error_handling`).\n\n```ruby\ndef capture_traffic\n  @proxy.new_har\n  yield\n  @proxy.har\nend\n\ndef error_handling(request)\n  request.on_complete do |response|\n    if response.success?\n      puts \"success\"\n    elsif response.timed_out?\n      puts \"got a time out\"\n    elsif response.code == 0\n      # Could not get an http response, something's wrong.\n      puts response.return_message\n    else\n      # Received a non-successful http response.\n      puts \"HTTP request failed: \" + response.code.to_s\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nNow for the meat of the issue -- replaying the requests.\n\n```ruby\ndef replay(http_requests, number_of_replays, debug = false)\n  requests = []\n  http_requests.entries.each do |entry|\n    requests << Typhoeus::Request.new(\n      entry.request.url,\n      method: entry.request.method.downcase.to_sym)\n  end\n\n  start_time = Time.now\n  puts \"Start time: #{start_time}\"\n  threads = []\n  number_of_replays.times do\n    threads << Thread.new do\n      requests.each do |request|\n        error_handling request if debug\n        request.run\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  threads.each {|thread| thread.join }\n  finish_time = Time.now\n  puts \"Finish time: #{finish_time}\"\n  puts \"#{number_of_replays} runs completed in #{finish_time - start_time} seconds\"\nend\n```\n\nWe start by iterating through each of the entries in the HAR payload, creating a new request for Typhoeus to use -- storing them all in an array.\n\nAfter printing the current time to the terminal, we create a new thread and execute all Typhoeus HTTP requests within it (outputting the error handling for each request if a debug parameter is passed in). This gets repeated based on the number of times specified when `replay` is called.\n\nAfter the threads run and terminate, we output the current time, and then list the total time run time along with the number of replays attempted.\n\nWe can now pull all of this together by implementing a simple `run` method.\n\n```ruby\ndef run\n  setup\n  http_requests = capture_traffic { yield }\n  teardown\n  replay(http_requests, 100)\nend\n```\n\nIf we wanted to see the debug output, we would pass in `true` as a third parameter like so:\n\n```ruby\nreplay(http_requests, 100, true)\n```\n\nNow that everything's wired up, we can drop our Selenium actions into a run block.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/2'\n  @driver.find_element(css: '#start button').click\n  Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(timeout: 8).until do\n    @driver.find_element(css: '#finish')\n  end\nend\n```\n\nIf we run this script without debugging turned on, then we should see something like this:\n\n```sh\nStart time: 2014-04-30 14:22:33 -0400\nFinish time: 2014-04-30 14:23:10 -0400\n100 runs completed in 37.575052 seconds\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n- Load a browser\n- Visit the page and complete the actions specified while capturing the HTTP requests\n- Close the browser and shutdown the proxy server\n- Replay the HTTP requests generated by Selenium 100 times in parallel\n\n## Summary\n\nHopefully this was helpful in helping you figure out how to do load testing.\n\nHappy Testing!"},39378:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'Load Testing'\nid: '48-load-testing'\nslug: /48-load-testing\nsidebar_label: Load Testing\ndescription: \"How do you do load testing in Selenium?

After which, a HAR file will appear in the working directory.\n\nThis outputted file is what we'll use to perform some simple benchmark checks.\n\nRather than identify specific benchmarks to check, let's run through a gamut of them by leveraging a pre-existing benchmarking tool like [YSlow](https://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/). Fortunately, there is [a command-line YSlow tool](http://yslow.org/command-line-har/) that can consume a HAR file and provide us with useful output.\n\nIt's a Node.js app. So first we'll need to [install Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), and then install the app (with `npm install yslow -g`).\n\nAfter that, we can run it from the command line like so:\n\n`yslow --info basic --format plain example.har`\n\nThis will consume a HAR file and output some helpful information -- including an overall score.\n\n```sh\nsize: 476.8K (476888 bytes)\noverall score: A (99)\nurl: http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/2\n# of requests: 16\nruleset: ydefault\n```\n\nThis overall score is what we are interested in. To get at it, we'll need to change the format type from `plain` to `json`.\n\n`yslow --info basic --format json example.har`\n\nThis will return a Hash that we can then easily parse through to get the value we want (e.g., the overall score with a key of `\"o\"`).\n\n```sh\n{\"w\":476887,\"o\":99,\"u\":\"http%3A%2F%2Fthe-internet.herokuapp.com%2Fdynamic_loading%2F2\",\"r\":16,\"i\":\"ydefault\"}\n```\n\nNow we can automate the YSlow command-line execution and perform an assertion by adding the following to the end of our script.\n\n```ruby\nperformance_results = JSON.parse `yslow --info basic --format json #{@har_file}`\nperformance_grade = performance_results[\"o\"]\nperformance_grade.should be > 95\n```\n\nNow when we run this if the overall score drops below a 95 out of 100 then the test will fail.\n\nFrom here we can wire this up to a Continuous Integration server and run it headlessly (either with Xvfb or GhostDriver) to perform these checks in an ongoing basis.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n+ Load the browser\n+ Capture all requests through the proxy server\n+ Save the captured requests to a HTTP Archive (HAR) file on disk\n+ Run the HAR file through YSlow to get a numeric grade\n+ Assert that the grade is above a certain level\n\n## Summary\n\nYou can see the full code example [here](https://gist.github.com/tourdedave/bc4b75fd6cdc1eef7860).\n\nFor more insights into what HAR is and the many uses of it, check out [this write-up and video from Ilya Grigorik's blog](http://www.igvita.com/2012/08/28/web-performance-power-tool-http-archive-har/).

This goes a long way towards identifying when something detrimental has been released into the wild.\n\nBut how do you catch performance issues before they reach production?\n\n## A Solution\n\nBy repurposing a Selenium script, we can run it through a proxy server and capture the HTTP traffic. With this\ntraffic, we can run some simple checks to see if the application's performance has degraded.\n\nLet's dig in with an example.\n\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals.

After visiting [the example application](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dropdown) we find the\ndropdown list by its ID and store it in a variable. We then find each element in the dropdown list (e.g., each\nelement with an `option` tag) with `FindElements` (note the plural).\n\nGrabbing all options with `FindElements` returns a collection that we iterate over. When the text matches\nwhat we want (e.g., `"Option 1"`) we click on it.\n\nWe finish the test by performing a check to see that our selection was made correctly. This is done by iterating\nover the dropdown options collection once more. This time we\'re getting the text of the item that was selected,\nstoring it in a variable, and making an assertion against it.\n\nWhile this works, there is a simpler, built-in way to do this with Selenium. Let\'s give that a go.\n\n### Example 2\n\nOur second example is `SelectFromDropdownTheEasyWay`, and similar to the first example, we are finding the dropdown\nlist by its ID. But instead of iterating over its option elements and clicking based on a conditional we are\nleveraging a built-in helper function of Selenium. With [`SelectElement`](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/T_OpenQA_Selenium_Support_UI_SelectElement.htm) and its `SelectBy` methods\n(e.g., [`SelectByText`](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/M_OpenQA_Selenium_Support_UI_SelectElement_SelectByText.htm)) we\'re able to easily choose the item we want.\n\nWe then perform our assertion against the text of the currently selected option\n(e.g., `Assert.AreEqual("Option 1", Dropdown.SelectedOption.Text)`).\n\nAs an aside, in addition to selecting by text you can also select by value.\n\n```csharp\n    Dropdown.SelectByValue("1");\n```\n\n### Executing the Test\n\nBefore executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the project file (e.g.,\n`csharp.csproj` in this case).\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>csharp.csproj</code> file.</summary>\n    <div>\n        <TipCode codePath={"5-select-from-a-dropdown/code/csharp/csharp.csproj"} language={"xml"}/>\n    </div>\n</details>\n\nFinally, we can run the test by executing `dotnet test` from the command-line.\n'},35419:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='import TipCode from "@site/src/components/tipCode";\n\n## TL;DR - Show Me The Code\n\n<TipCode\n    codePath={"5-select-from-a-dropdown/code/java/src/test/java/com/elemental/selenium/DropdownTest.java"}\n    language={"java"}/>\n\n\n## Code Walkthrough\n\n### Importing Libraries, Setup and Teardown\n\nFirst let\'s import our requisite classes (for annotations (e.g., `org.junit.After`, etc.), driving the\nbrowser with Selenium (e.g., `org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver`, etc.), and matchers for our assertions\n(e.g., `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions`, etc.)), and start our class with some setup and teardown\nmethods.\n\nNext, we\'ll start our class off with some setup and teardown methods.\n\n### Example 1\n\nOur first example is `dropdownTest`, after visiting [the example application](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dropdown) we find the dropdown list by\nits ID and store it in a variable. We then find each clickable element in the dropdown list (e.g., each `option`)\nwith `findElements` (note the plural).\n\nGrabbing all options with `findElements` returns a collection that we iterate over. When the text matches\nwhat we want, we click on it.\n\nWe finish the test by performing a check to see that our selection was made correctly. This is done by iterating\nover the dropdown options collection one more time. This time we\'re getting the text of the item that was selected,\nstoring it in a variable, and making an assertion against it.\n\nWhile this works, there is a more accessible way to do this.\n\n### Example 2\n\nOur second example is `dropdownTestRedux`, and similar to the first example, we are finding the dropdown list by\nits ID.

Instead of first finding the dropdown list, we will employ a more robust locator\n(e.g., XPath) to find an element within the dropdown list that contains our target text -- and click it.\n\nWe then determine what has been selected in the dropdown list by using one more powerful locator (e.g., a\nCSS selector). This time, looking to see which option has the `selected` attribute, and grabbing its text. We\nuse this found text to assert that the correct item was chosen.\n\n### Executing the Test\n\nBefore executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `package.json` file.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>package.json</code> file.</summary>\n    <div>\n        <TipCode codePath={"5-select-from-a-dropdown/code/javascript/package.json"} language={"json"}/>\n    </div>\n</details>\n\nFinally, we can run the test by executing `npm test` from the command-line.'},39917:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='import TipCode from "@site/src/components/tipCode";\n\n## TL;DR - Show Me The Code\n\n<TipCode codePath={"5-select-from-a-dropdown/code/python/dropdown.py"} language={"python"}/>\n\n## Code Walkthrough\n\n### Importing Libraries, Setup and Teardown\n\nThe first lines are pulling in our requisite libraries our testing framework (e.g., `import pytest`),\ndriving the browser with Selenium (e.g., `from selenium import webdriver`), and a locator strategy to\nfind the elements (e.g. `from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By`), and wire up some setup and\nteardown methods for our tests.\n\n### Example 1\n\nAfter visiting [the example application](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dropdown) we find the dropdown list by its ID and store it in a variable.

A quick\nsearch through the official Selenium documentation can also be confusing, and might leave you scouring online forums\nand search engines for the solution.\n\n## A Solution\n\nThe most popular use case for a hover action is to display additional menu options(submenu.)\n\nBy leveraging Selenium's [Action Builder](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/T_OpenQA_Selenium_Interactions_Actions.htm) we can handle more complex user interactions like hovers. This is\ndone by telling Selenium which element we want to move the mouse to, and then performing what we need to after.\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},\n    {label: 'C#', value: 'csharp'},\n    {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},\n    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript'},\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals.

It lets you distribute test execution across several\n> machines. You can connect to it with a remote WebDriver by specifying the browser, browser version, and operating\n> system you want. You specify these values through Selenium `Capabilities`.There are two main elements to Selenium Grid -- a Hub, and Nodes. First you need to stand up a Hub. Then you can\n> connect (or \"register\") Nodes to that Hub.\n> Nodes are where your tests will run, and the Hub is responsible for making sure your tests end up on the right\n> one (e.g., the machine with the operating system and browser you specified in your test).\n\n\nLet's continue with an example.\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},\n    {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},\n    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript'},\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals.

To see \nyour sessions, navigate to the instance in your web browser (http://localhost:4444/) and then click Sessions in the \nside panel. This session ID maps to a URI endpoint on the Selenium Server that we use to get the logging payload \nwith an HTTP POST (see `fetch`). We are then taking that payload (which comes back as a JSON object in String form) \nand parsing it into JSON, iterating through it, grabbing the relevant bits we want (see `parse`). When that's all \ndone, we return the last entry found (see `latest`).\n\nAnd of [all the available log types we can access](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Logging#Log_Types), we're grabbing the client logs \n(which will give us the real time actions taken in our test).\n\n__NOTE: Each time we access the logs, it will clear the cache of logs. So the next time we access them, it will \nonly return new entries.__\n\nNow we're ready to wire up our test to use the Selenium Server, access our logger class, and output the latest \nlog entries after each Selenium action.\n\n```ruby\n# filename: log_test.rb\n\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rspec/expectations'\ninclude RSpec::Matchers\nrequire_relative 'logger'\n\ndef setup\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :remote, url: 'http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub'\n  @logger = Logger.new(@driver.session_id)\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'https://the-internet.herokuapp.com'\n  puts @logger.latest\n  @driver.find_elements(css: 'a').last.click\n  puts @logger.latest\nend\n```\n\nWhen we run this (e.g., `ruby log_test.rb`), here's what we should see.\n\n```sh\n Done: [get: http://the-internet.herokuapp.com]\n Done: [click: 23 [[FirefoxDriver: firefox on MAC (2afa5f83-1aba-ad43-b1f3-9b4907ae9471)] -> css selector: a]]\n```\n\nIf we couple this with jQuery Growl Notifications ([covered in the last tip](https://elementalselenium.com/docs/growl/53-growl)) \nthen we can really put this information to work.\n\nLet's add some helper methods to add jQuery Growl to the page and display notification messages.\n\n```ruby\ndef add_growl_notifications\n  @driver.execute_script(\"if (!window.jQuery) {\n      var jquery = document.createElement('script'); jquery.type = 'text/javascript';\n      jquery.src = 'https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.2/jquery.min.js';\n      document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(jquery);\n    }\")\n\n  @driver.execute_script(\"$.getScript('http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/js/vendor/jquery.growl.js')\")\n\n  @driver.execute_script(\"$('head').append('<link rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\" href=\\\"http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/css/jquery.growl.css\\\" type=\\\"text/css\\\" />');\")\nend\n\ndef display_growl_message(message)\n  @driver.execute_script(\"$.growl({ title: 'Selenium', message: '#{message}' });\")\n  sleep 2\nend\n```\n\nNow let's update our test to perform an action and then display it through jQuery Growl notifications.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com'\n  add_growl_notifications\n  display_growl_message(@logger.latest)\nend\n```\n\nWhen we run this (e.g., `ruby log_test.rb`), we should see the latest log action appear in a growl notification within \nthe browser window.\n\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n+ Load the browser\n+ Take an action\n+ Grab the action from the logs\n+ Display the action\n\n## Summary\n\nHopefully that was a helpful tip on how to get browser-agnostic, real-time logging information.\n\nHappy Testing!\n"},16479:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: \"How to Access Selenium Logs in Real-Time\"\nid: \"54-logging\"\nslug: /54-logging\nsidebar_label: \"How to Access Selenium Logs in Real-Time\"\ndescription: \"Logging is a deep rabbit hole to fall down in Selenium.

This is a class which comes preloaded with helper methods that enable us to add behavior before and after common Selenium actions -- here's a list of the available methods:\n\n- `before_navigate_to`\n- `after_navigate_to`\n- `before_navigate_back`\n- `after_navigate_back`\n- `before_navigate_forward`\n- `after_navigate_forward`\n- `before_find`\n- `after_find`\n- `before_click`\n- `after_click`\n- `before_change_value_of`\n- `after_change_value_of`\n- `before_execute_script`\n- `after_execute_script`\n- `before_quit`\n- `after_quit`\n- `before_close`\n- `after_close`\n\nWe can pick and choose from each of these methods and specify the additional behavior we want to occur. After that, it's just a simple matter of passing this information to Selenium when creating a browser instance.\n\nHere is an example.\n\n## Example\n\nTo start, let's create a `Wrapper` class that inherits from `AbstractEventListener` and add our behavior there.\n\nThe helper methods we're interested in are `after_navigate_to`, `before_find`, `after_find`, `before_click`, and `after_click` and they each require different arguments to be specified. See [here](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/rb/lib/selenium/webdriver/support/abstract_event_listener.rb#30) for details.\n\nAnd to make things interesting, let's wire up jQuery Growl notifications.\n\n```ruby\n# filename: wrapper.rb\n\nclass Wrapper < Selenium::WebDriver::Support::AbstractEventListener\n\n  def after_navigate_to(url, driver)\n    add_growl(driver)\n    display_growl(driver, \"Navigated to #{url}\")\n  end\n\n  def before_find(by, what, driver)\n    display_growl(driver, \"Finding element #{what}\")\n  end\n\n  def after_find(by, what, driver)\n    display_growl(driver, \"Found element #{what}\")\n  end\n\n  def before_click(element, driver)\n    display_growl(driver, \"Clicking on #{element.text}\")\n    @pre_click_url = driver.current_url\n  end\n\n  def after_click(element, driver)\n    unless @pre_click_url == driver.current_url\n      add_growl(driver)\n      display_growl(driver, \"URL changed to #{driver.current_url}\")\n    end\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def add_growl(driver)\n     driver.execute_script(\"if (!window.jQuery) {\n        var jquery = document.createElement('script'); jquery.type = 'text/javascript';\n        jquery.src = 'https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.2/jquery.min.js';\n        document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(jquery);\n      }\")\n\n    driver.execute_script(\"$.getScript('http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/js/vendor/jquery.growl.js')\")\n\n    driver.execute_script(\"$('head').append('<link rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\" href=\\\"http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/css/jquery.growl.css\\\" type=\\\"text/css\\\" />');\")\n\n    sleep 1\n  end\n\n  def display_growl(driver, message)\n    driver.execute_script(\"$.growl({ title: 'Selenium', message: '#{message}' });\")\n    sleep 0.5\n  end\n\nend\n```\n\nOur Event Listener helper methods give us access to the driver object at the precise moments we want in our test steps, and by wiring up growl notifications (see `add_growl` and `display_growl`) we can now display notification messages in the browser window automatically without any additional work in our test code.\n\nLet's go ahead and wire up our test code to use this new wrapper.\n\n```ruby\n# filename: wrapper_test.rb\n\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire_relative 'wrapper'\nrequire 'rspec/expectations'\ninclude RSpec::Matchers\n\ndef setup\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox, listener: Wrapper.new\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com'\n  @driver.find_elements(css: 'a').last.click\nend\n```\n\nEverything here is pretty standard with the exception of two small changes to handle our wrapper. We first need to include the file (`require_relative 'wrapper'`) and then pass in an instance of the wrapper to Selenium (`listener: Wrapper.new`).\n\nNow if we run our test (`ruby wrapper_test.rb`) then we will see notification messages appear around each of the test actions as they occur.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n- Load the browser\n- Load jQuery if it's not already loaded\n- Load jQuery Growl and it's styles\n- Display notifications in the browser window for each of the test actions\n\n## Summary\n\nTo see a video demo of this test, [click here](https://vimeo.com/98736887).\n\nHappy Testing!\n"},44582:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'Wrapper'\nid: '55-wrapper'\nslug: /55-wrapper\nsidebar_label: Wrapper\ndescription: \"There may come a time when you want to access Selenium logs in real time.

That way the list of failures will \npersist after the suite of tests completes, so we can perform a retry action using the list of failures.\n\nThankfully RSpec comes with some of the plumbing to help accomplish this -- through the use of a \n[custom formatter](https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec/wiki/Custom-Formatters); specifically the [base formatter](http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/2.6.4/RSpec/Core/Formatters/BaseFormatter).\n\nLet's create one.\n\n```ruby\n# filename: failure_catcher.rb\n\nrequire 'rspec/core/formatters/base_formatter'\n\nclass FailureCatcher < RSpec::Core::Formatters::BaseFormatter\n\n  # create files called rspec_#.failures with a list of failed examples\n  def dump_failures\n    return if failed_examples.empty?\n    f = File.new(\"rspec#{ENV['TEST_ENV_NUMBER']}.failures\", \"w+\")\n    failed_examples.each do |example|\n      f.puts retry_command(example)\n    end\n    f.close\n  end\n\n  def retry_command(example)\n    example_name = example.full_description.gsub(\"\\\"\", \"\\\\\\\"\")\n    \"-e \\\"#{example_name}\\\"\"\n  end\n\nend\n```\n\nIn order to extend the base formatter we first need to require it, and then inherit from it when declaring our \nclass (e.g., `< RSpec::Core::Formatters::BaseFormatter`).\n\nAfter that we have access to the helper method we want (e.g., `dump_failures`). In `dump_failures` we can access \ndetailed information about each failed test through the `failed_examples` accessor.\n\nAfter checking to see if there are any failed examples, we create a new uniquely named file (leveraging the \nenvironment variable created by our parallel executor), iterate through all failed examples, and store a \nproperly formatted retry execution command with the name of the failed test.\n\nTo use this formatter we'll need to specify it at run-time, and to leverage a retry action we'll need to wrap our \nrun-time execution. Let's wire all of this up using [Rake](https://github.com/jimweirich/rake).\n\n```ruby\n# filename: Rakefile\n\ndef gather_failures\n  opts = \"\"\n  files = Dir.glob('*.failures')\n  files.each { |file| opts << File.read(file).gsub(/\\n/, ' ') }\n  all_failures = './all.failures'\n  File.write(all_failures, opts.rstrip)\n  return File.read all_failures\nend\n\ndef cleanup(files = '')\n  system(\"rm #{files}\") unless Dir.glob(\"#{files}\").empty?\nend\n\ndef launch(params = {})\n  if params[:test_options].include? '-e'\n    count = params[:test_options].split(/failed/).count - 1\n    puts \"Retrying #{count} failed tests!\"\n  end\n  system(\"parallel_rspec -n #{params[:processes] || 5} \\\n          --test-options '#{params[:test_options]}' spec\")\nend\n\ndef run(processes = 5)\n  launch(processes: processes,\n    test_options: '--require ./failure_catcher.rb \\\n    --format FailureCatcher')\nend\n\ndef rerun(processes = 5)\n  launch(processes: processes, test_options: gather_failures)\nend\n\ndesc \"parallel test execution with failure retries\"\ntask :run_tests, :number_of_processes do |t, args|\n  run args[:number_of_processes]\n  unless $?.success?\n    rerun args[:number_of_processes]\n    cleanup '*.failures'\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThere are five methods and one Rake task. The first two methods (`gather_failures` and `cleanup`) are for rounding \nup a list of failed tests from the *.failure files and deleting them when we're finished. The next three methods \n(`launch`, `run`, and `rerun`) are for executing the test suite and retrying just the failures.\n\nThe Rake task is where we tie everything together.\n\nIn it, we make the number of concurrent processes configurable through the use of an optional run-time argument. \nWe then call `run` (passing in the argument) which executes the full suite. After the suite completes, \nwe perform a check against the exit code to see if there were any failures. If there were, then we call \n`rerun` (along with the argument for number of processes),  and then call `cleanup` to remove the failure files.\n\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n+ Tests execute in parallel\n+ A list of failed tests get stored in output files (one for each process)\n+ Failed tests get rerun\n+ Output files for failed tests get deleted\n\n## Summary\n\nHat-tip to [rspec-rerun](https://github.com/dblock/rspec-rerun) for the initial implementation, and to [the write-up that led me there](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2012/05/15/how-to-organize-over-3000-rspec-specs-and-retry-test-failures/).\n\nHappy Testing!\n"},85766:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: \"How to Automatically Retry Failed Tests\"\nid: \"56-retry-failed-tests\"\nslug: /56-retry-failed-tests\nsidebar_label: \"How to Automatically Retry Failed Tests\"\ndescription: \"You want reliable tests.

There are two popular ones:\n\n+ [yarjuf (Yet Another RSpec JUnit Formatter)](https://github.com/natritmeyer/yarjuf)\n+ [RSpec JUnit Formatter](https://github.com/sj26/rspec_junit_formatter)\n\nLet's step through how to use the latter of the two.\n\nAfter installing RSpec JUnit Formatter we need to specify two new parameters at run-time: a formatter, and an output file.\n\n```sh\nrspec --format RspecJunitFormatter  --out result.xml\n```\n\nRunning tests with these parameters will format the test results into JUnit XML and pipe them into a `result.xml` file (and overwrite it on subsequent runs).\n\nIf we didn't want to type these parameters out every time we could place them into an RSpec command helper file (e.g., `.rspec`).\n\n```ruby\n# filename: .rspec\n\n--format RspecJunitFormatter\n--out result.xml\n```\n\nIf we want to run our tests in parallel (using something like [parallel_tests](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests)), then we will want to generate a uniquely named result file for each parallel process (otherwise concurrent test runs will overwrite the same file rendering the results effectively useless). To do that we can use interpolation thanks to [ERB](http://www.stuartellis.eu/articles/erb/) and an environment variable made available by parallel_tests.\n\nThankfully parallel_tests has a RSpec command helper file as well (e.g., `.parallel_rspec`).\n\n```ruby\n# filename: .parallel_rspec\n\n--format RspecJunitFormatter\n--out result<%= ENV['TEST_ENV_NUMBER'] %>.xml\n```\n\nNow with numerous tests being run through `parallel_tests` the final result will be a series of JUnit XML files (e.g., `result1.xml`, `result2.xml`, etc.).\n\nAnd if we didn't want this to run all the time (like if we only wanted JUnit XML output to get generated when running our tests on a CI server) then we can add a conditional to our `.parallel_rspec` file.\n\n```ruby\n# filename: .parallel_rspec\n\n<% if ENV['CI'] %>\n--format RspecJunitFormatter\n--out results/result<%= ENV['TEST_ENV_NUMBER'] %>.xml\n<% end %>\n```\n\nNow all we need to do is specify an environment variable at run time in order to trigger JUnit XML output (e.g., `CI=on parallel_rspec`).\n\n## Summary\n\nNow you're ready to plug your Selenium tests into a CI Server and let them report the results.\n"},16903:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'How To Prepare Your Tests For Continuous Integration'\nid: '57-junit-xml'\nslug: /57-junit-xml\nsidebar_label: \"How To Prepare Your Tests For Continuous Integration\"\ndescription: \"If you want your Selenium tests to automatically run and report failures to you and your team, you'll want to wire them up to a Continuous Integration server.\"\nnumber: 57\nhide_table_of_contents: true\nlevel: 1\npublish_date: 2015-07-14\ntags:\n  - 'xml'\n  - 'junit xml'\n  - 'ci'\n  - 'continuous integration'\n  - 'reporting'\ncategory:\n  - 'tools'\n---\n\n# How to Prepare Your Tests for Continuous Integration\n\n## Intro\n\nIf you want your Selenium tests to automatically run and report failures to you and your team, you'll want to wire them up to a [Continuous Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) (CI) server.\n\nIn order to make the most of the Continuous Integration setup, you'll need to make sure your test suite outputs a machine readable test report. But what does this entail? How do you set it up? And will it work when running things in parallel?\n\n## A Solution\n\nCI servers work with a standardized report format called JUnit XML which is a standard offering across testing\nframeworks. If it's not something available off the shelf for your framework, odds are there's a plug-in to enable it.\n\nThe report will include test results (e.g., failure messages and stack traces) and test metrics (e.g., start time,\nend time, number of tests, etc.). Your CI server (once configured to do so) will consume this report after each\ntest run and tell you when things pass and fail. It will also offer trend data over time to help determine the\nstability of your test suite.\n\nLet's go through an example of how to configure a test suite in order to output a JUnit XML report.\n\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals.

The `requirements.txt` file contains the libraries we\nneed to install.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>requirements.txt</code> file.</summary>\n    <div>\n        <TipCode codePath={"6-open-new-window/code/python/requirements.txt"} language={"txt"}/>\n    </div>\n</details>\n\nAfter installing the required libraries, we can run the test by executing `pytest new_window_and_tab.py` from the\ncommand-line.\n\n'},54095:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='import TipCode from "@site/src/components/tipCode";\n\n## TL;DR - Show Me The Code\n\n<TipCode codePath={"6-open-new-window/code/ruby/new_window_and_tab.rb"} language={"ruby"}/>\n\n## Code Walkthrough\n\n### Importing Libraries\n\nFirst, we are pulling in our requisite classes (e.g., `selenium-webdriver` to drive the browser,\nand `rspec/expectations` & `RSpec::Matchers` for our assertion).\n\n### Setup and Teardown\n\nNext, we are setting up and tearing down the browser instance. We\'re using the `setup` method to launch a new\ninstance of Firefox with Selenium and storing it in a class variable that we\'ll use throughout all tests. After our\ntest executes the `teardown` method will execute. This calls `driver.quit()` which ends the session by closing the\nbrowser instance.\n\nThe `run` method is a custom method that we\'ve defined to execute our test. It\'s a simple wrapper around the `setup`\nand `teardown` methods. We\'re using it to keep our test code clean and easy to read.\n\n### Open New Window\n\nThe first test shows how to open a new window, switch to it, and assert the number of window handles open. They key\nto this is the `@driver.switch_to.new_window(:window)` line. Which opens a new window and switches to it.\n\n### Open New Tab\n\nThe second test shows how to open a new tab, switch to it, and assert the number of window handles open. They key to\nthis is the `@driver.switch_to.new_window(:tab)` line. Which opens a new tab and switches to it.\n\n### Executing the Test\n\nBefore executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `Gemfile` file.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>Gemfile</code> file.</summary>\n    <div>\n        <TipCode codePath={"6-open-new-window/code/ruby/Gemfile"} language={"txt"}/>\n    </div>\n</details>\n\n\nFinally, we can run the test by executing `ruby new_window_and_tab.rb` from the command-line.\n'},27736:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='import TipCode from "@site/src/components/tipCode";\n\n## TL;DR - Show Me The Code\n\n<TipCode\n    codePath={"6-open-new-window/code/selenide/src/test/java/com/elemental/selenium/NewWindowNewTabTest.java"}\n    language={"java"}/>\n\n## Code Walkthrough\n\n### Importing Libraries\n\nFirst, we pull in our requisite classes:\n  * test runner (e.g., `org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach`, etc.),\n  * opening the browser with Selenide (e.g., `com.codeborne.selenide.Selenide.open`),\n  * matchers for assertions (e.g., `org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat`)\n\n### Setup and Teardown\n\nAfter specifying the namespace and the class (e.g., `public class NewWindowNewTabTest`), \nwe add `BrowserPerTestStrategyExtension` - this is Selenide extension for JUnit5 that closes the browser after every test.\n\nIt\'s not always needed, but in this specific class every test opens few windows or tabs, so \nit\'s easier to close the whole browser with all tabs and windows. \n\n### Open New Window\n\n`newWindow` shows how to open a new window, switch to it, and assert the number of window handles open. They key\nto this is the `switchTo().newWindow(WindowType.WINDOW)` line. Which opens a new window and switches to it.\n\n### Open New Tab\n\n`newTab` shows how to open a new tab, switch to it, and assert the number of window handles open. They key to this\nis the `switchTo().newWindow(WindowType.TAB)` line. Which opens a new tab and switches to it.\n\n### Additional checks\nAlso, in `newTab` test we showed how you can check some details of current window/tab. \nSelenide has a number of built-in checks for URL, title etc.\n\n### Executing the Test\n\nBefore executing the test, we need to make sure the required dependencies are declared on the `pom.xml` file.\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Toggle to see the <code>pom.xml</code> file.</summary>\n    <div>\n        <TipCode codePath={"6-open-new-window/code/selenide/pom.xml"} language={"xml"}/>\n    </div>\n</details>\n\nFinally, we can run the test by executing `mvn test` from the command-line.'},29944:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='using System;\nusing Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;\nusing

'new tab'\n  - 'no keystrokes needed'\nlevel: 1\ncategory:\n  - 'fundamentals'\n---\n\n## The Problem\n\nNearly everyone, at some point during their normal flow of work on the computer, has had to open a new window or\ntab. In fact, many of us often end up with several tabs open. It makes sense that this should be tested using\nautomation.\n\nPreviously, you may have sent keystrokes to open a new tab or window with a send keys method and `Command t`\n(macOS) or `Control n` (Windows/Linux). However, this doesn't translate well across different operating systems\nand browser versions.\n\n## A Solution\n\nMost modern browser automation tools have a built-in method to open a new window or tab. This method allows you to\ncreate a new window or new tab (without needing a keyboard input), then select that new tab or window, and navigate\nto a website.\n\n## Example\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},\n    {label: 'C#', value: 'csharp'},\n    {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},\n    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript'},\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n    {label: 'Selenide', value: 'selenide'},\n]}/>\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n- Open Firefox browser\n- Navigate to the-internet website\n- Open a New Window and move it to a different position on the screen\n- Navigate to the Typos page on the-internet website\n- Check the number of windows open\n- Close all browsers\n\n## Outro\n\nThere are many possible use cases for this new way of opening and focusing on new browser tabs and windows across\nOS and browser combinations.\n\nFrom testing the way a user can interact with two windows side-by-side, to testing performance and behavior\nof multiple windows, this new command makes it simpler to test on multiple web pages.\n\nHappy Testing!\n\n## Authors\n\nimport DefaultAvatar from \"@site/src/components/defaultAvatar\";\n\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name=\"Lindsay Walker \"\n    imgSrc={\"https://github.com/walkerlj0.png\"}\n    description={\"Creator of this tip\"}\n    url={\"https://github.com/walkerlj0\"}\n    author={true}\n/>\n\n<DefaultAvatar\n    name=\"Diego Molina\"\n    imgSrc={\"https://github.com/diemol.png\"}\n    description={\"Maintainer of Elemental Selenium\"}\n    url={\"https://github.com/diemol\"}\n    author={true}\n/>"},24269:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r='## Example\n\nTo do this in RSpec, we\'re going to leverage `RSpec.configure` in a file called `tag_lister.rb`. To keep things simple, let\'s wrap this behavior in a method called `list_tags` and have it live within a module called `TagLister`.\n\n```ruby\n# filename: tag_lister.rb\n\nrequire \'rspec\'\n\nmodule TagLister\n  def self.list_tags\n    RSpec.configure do |c|\n      c.add_setting :tags\n      c.before(:suite) { RSpec.configuration.tags = {} }\n```\n\nIn our RSpec configuration we first need to create a place to store the tag data, so we add a setting called `tags` and make it a hash.\n\nNow we\'re ready to go through each test to find the tag data.\n\n```ruby\n# filename: tag_lister.rb\n\n...\n      c.around(:each) do |example|\n        tag_recorder = RSpec.configuration.tags\n        standard_keys = [:example_group,\n                         :block,\n                         :description_args,\n                         :caller,\n                         :execution_result,\n                         :full_description,\n                         :line_number,\n                         :file_path,\n                         :description,\n                         :described_class,\n                         :location]\n        example.metadata.each do |key, value|\n          this_tag = "#{key}:#{value}" unless standard_keys.include?(key)\n          unless this_tag.nil?\n            tag_recorder[this_tag] = [] unless tag_recorder[this_tag]\n            tag_recorder[this_tag] << [\n              example.metadata[:full_description],\n              example.metadata[:file_path],\n              example.metadata[:line_number]\n            ]\n          end\n        end\n      end\n\n```\n\nIn `around(:each)` we\'re able to interogate each test (a.k.a. `example`) to see if it contains any data in addition to the standard set of keys that we can expect from RSpec. If it does, then we assume that these additional keys are tags and store the test name, path to test file, and line number of the test file that uses this tag (or these tags).\n\nWe store this information in an array (and potentially an array of arrays) within our `tags` hash. Here\'s a sample data set to help wrap your head around it:\n\n```ruby\n{"wip:true"=>[["One passes", "./spec/one_spec.rb", 2], ["One fails", "./spec/one_spec.rb", 3]],\n"smoke:true"=>[["Three passes", "./spec/three_spec.rb", 2], ["Three fails", "./spec/three_spec.rb", 3]],\n"story:BIZ-1234"=>[["Two passes", "./spec/two_spec.rb", 2]], "story:BIZ-1235"=>[["Two fails", "./spec/two_spec.rb", 3]]}\n```\n\nNow that we have all the tags and the test data that shows where they are in use, we can generate a simple report with it.\n\n```ruby\n# filename: tag_lister.rb\n\n...\n      c.after(:suite) do\n        tags = RSpec.configuration.tags\n\n        case ENV[\'TAG_SORT_ORDER\']\n        when \'alphabetical\'\n          tags = tags.sort_by { |tag| tag[0] }\n        when \'usage\'\n          tags = tags.sort_by { |tag| tag[1].count }.reverse\n        end\n\n        puts "\\n\\n"\n        puts "***************"\n        puts "* TAGS IN USE *"\n        puts "***************"\n        puts "\\n"\n\n        tags.each do |tag|\n          puts "#{tag[0]} (used #{tag[1].count} times)"\n          tag[1].each do |test_data|\n            puts "  #{test_data[0]} (#{test_data[1]}:#{test_data[2]})\\n"\n          end\n        end\n\n        puts "\\n#{tags.count} tags in use: sorted in #{ENV[\'TAG_SORT_ORDER\']} order"\n\n      end\n    end\n\n```\n\nThere are a couple of different ways we\'ll likely want to see the tag data. So we wire up the ability to sort alphabetically by tag name as well as by usage in descending order (e.g., the number of times a tag is used). In our current tagging data structure, `tag[0]` is the tag name (a.k.a. the hash key) and `tag[1]` is the array that contains an array (or multiple arrays) of test data.\n\nAfter sorting the tags, we output a heading (e.g., `* TAGS IN USE*`), iterate through the collection of tag & test data, and close things out with a summary statement (listing the total tag count and sorting method used).\n\nNow we just need to pull in our test files, start RSpec, and then add a trigger to run everything.\n\n```ruby\n# filename: tag_lister.rb\n\n...\n    tests = Dir.glob(File.join(Dir.getwd, \'spec/**/*\'))\n    RSpec::Core::Runner.run(tests)\n\n  end\nend\n\nENV[\'TAG_SORT_ORDER\'] = ARGV[0] || \'usage\'\nTagLister.list_tags\n```\n\nThis script is built to live one level up from the test directory. And it assumes that the test directory is called `spec`.\n\nWe make it, so we can pass an argument at runtime, which then gets fed into the tag sorting environment variable (`ENV[\'TAG_SORT_ORDER\']`). If no argument is provided, we default the value to `\'usage\'`.\n\nWhen we save this and run it with `ruby tag_lister.rb`, we should see a report outputted in the terminal.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```sh\n......\n\n***************\n* TAGS IN USE *\n***************\n\nwip:true (used 2 times)\n  One passes (./spec/one_spec.rb:2)\n  One fails (./spec/one_spec.rb:3)\nsmoke:true (used 2 times)\n  Three passes (./spec/three_spec.rb:2)\n  Three fails (./spec/three_spec.rb:3)\nstory:BIZ-1234 (used 1 times)\n  Two passes (./spec/two_spec.rb:2)\nstory:BIZ-1235 (used 1 times)\n  Two fails (./spec/two_spec.rb:3)\n\n4 tags in use: sorted in usage order\n\n\nFinished in 0.00106 seconds (files took 0.09029 seconds to load)\n6 examples, 0 failures\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n+ Iterate over each test, collecting tags and their test data\n+ Display a report in the terminal of tags in use (sorted based on run-time preference)\n\n## Summary\n\nIf you\'d like to see the code and example specs used to generate the above report, you can find them [here](https://github.com/tourdedave/rspec-list-tags).\n\nHappy Testing!\n'},67911:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'List Tags'\nid: '60-list-tags'\nslug: /60-list-tags\nsidebar_label: List Tags\ndescription: \"Tagging is a powerful tool for targeted test execution, as well as a lightweight form of documentation.

This can be done to a specific element, or\ngenerically with Selenium's Action Builder (which has been documented on\n[the Selenium Actions page for Building Advanced User Interactions](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/T_OpenQA_Selenium_Interactions_Actions.htm)).\n\nEither approach will send a key press. The latter approach will send it to the element that's currently in\nfocus in the browser (so you don't have to specify a locator along with it), whereas the prior approach will\nsend the key press directly to the element found.\n\nYou can see a full list of Selenium's available keyboard keys [here](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/T_OpenQA_Selenium_Keys.htm).\n\nLet's try out a couple of examples.\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},\n    {label: 'C#', value: 'csharp'},\n    {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},\n    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript'},\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals.

You connectto it by configuring a browser profile to pass through it. As listed on[the BrowserMob Proxy GitHub page](https://github.com/lightbody/browsermob-proxy#features-and-usage), here are someof the benefits it offers:+ blacklisting and whitelisting certain URL patterns+ simulating various bandwidth and latency+ remapping DNS lookups+ flushing DNS caching+ controlling DNS and request timeouts+ automatic BASIC authorization\n\n__NOTE:__ You can also capture HTTP status codes with it as well. See [tip 17](/tips/17-retrieve-http-status-codes) for details on how to do that.\n\nLet's continue with an example.\n\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals.

But\nhow do you interrogate your locators to make sure they are doing what you expect?\n\n## A Solution\n\nBy leveraging some simple JavaScript and CSS styling, we can highlight the element on the page that we're targeting.\nThis way we can visually inspect it to make sure it is the one that we want.\n\nLet's take a look at an example.\n\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},\n    {label: 'C#', value: 'csharp'},\n    {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},\n    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript'},\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n"},8748:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="## Example\n\n__NOTE: For a brief primer on proxy servers check out [tip 64](/tips/64-limit-bandwidth).__\n\nTo get started we'll need to download a copy of Browsermob Proxy ([link](http://bmp.lightbody.net/)) and write our script. In it, we'll pull in our requisite libraries (e.g., `browsermob/proxy` to control the proxy server, `selenium-webdriver` to drive the browser, and `rspec/expectations` and it's matchers to perform assertions).\n\nAfter that, we'll configure the proxy server and wire up some simple `setup`, `teardown`, and `run` methods. As part of `setup` we'll want to configure the blacklist. To do that we'll add a regular expression to find the resource we want to block and the status code we'd like the resource to be changed to (e.g., blocking a resource from loading with a `200` response code and having it return a `404` instead).\n\n```ruby\n# filename: blacklist.rb\n\nrequire 'browsermob/proxy'\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rspec/expectations'\ninclude RSpec::Matchers\n\ndef configure_proxy\n  server = BrowserMob::Proxy::Server.new('./browsermob-proxy-2.0-beta-9/bin/browsermob-proxy')\n  server.start\n  @proxy = server.create_proxy\n  profile = Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox::Profile.new\n  profile.proxy = @proxy.selenium_proxy\n  return profile\nend\n\ndef setup\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox, profile: configure_proxy\n  @proxy.blacklist('http:\\/\\/the-internet.herokuapp.com\\/slow_external', 404)\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\n  @proxy.close\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n```\n\nNow we're ready to wire up our test. Let's use an example from [the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet) that has a slow loading resource. It has a rogue `GET` request that takes 30 seconds to load. You can see it [here](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/slow).\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @proxy.new_har\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/slow'\n  entry = @proxy.har.entries.find { |e| e.request.url.include? 'slow_external' }\n  expect(entry).not_to be_nil\n  expect(entry.response.status).to eq(404)\nend\n```\n\nWe start the test by creating a new HTTP Archive (HAR) for tracking the page requests. We then load the example page, find the entry for the slow loading resource from the HAR, and assert that the response code for it is `404`.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nIf you save this file and run it (e.g., `ruby blacklist.rb` from the command-line) here is what will happen:\n\n+ Proxy server starts\n+ Proxy server session created\n+ Browser opens\n+ Visit the page\n+ Find the entry we want from the HTTP Archive\n+ Check that the HTTP status code for the entry has the correct status code from the blacklist\n+ Browser closes\n+ Proxy session closes\n\n## Summary\n\nHopefully this helps you with blocking external resources that you don't want to load during testing.\n\nHappy Testing!\n\n"},96364:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'Blacklist'\nid: '66-blacklist'\nslug: /66-blacklist\nsidebar_label: Blacklist\ndescription: \"There are plenty of external resources that get loaded onto a page that aren't directly relevant to the functionality you're testing (e.g., Facebook widgets, Analytics, JavaScript snippets, etc.).

There are additional requests being made, but it's substantially faster since it has less overhead.\n\n## Example 3 - A JavaScript Example\n\n```ruby\n# filename: broken_image_3.rb\n\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rspec/expectations'\ninclude RSpec::Matchers\n\ndef setup\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/broken_images'\n\n  all_images = @driver.find_elements tag_name: 'img'\n\n  broken_images = all_images.reject do |image|\n    @driver.execute_script(\n      \"return arguments[0].complete && \\\n        typeof arguments[0].naturalWidth != \\\"undefined\\\" && \\\n        arguments[0].naturalWidth > 0\",\n      image)\n  end\n\n  expect(broken_images).to be_empty\nend\n```\n\nIf you save this file and run it (e.g., `broken_image_3.rb` from the command-line) here is what will happen:\n\n+ Open the browser\n+ Find all images on the page\n+ Iterate through each image and inspect that it finished loading and has a defined width\n+ Store images that fail inspection in a collection\n+ Assert that the collection is empty\n\nThis is the leanest approach since it requires no additional setup or extra requests. It's just a matter of executing some JavaScript code to inspect the images.\n\n## Summary\n\nYour circumstance may vary, so choose the approach that works best for you and your team.\n\nA big thanks to [Brian Goad](https://twitter.com/bbbco) for the JavaScript solution and pointing me towards [the StackOverflow post where he first came across this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16784534/find-broken-images-in-page-image-replace-by-another-image/).\n\nHappy Testing!\n"},71010:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'Broken Images'\nid: '67-broken-images'\nslug: /67-broken-images\nsidebar_label: Broken Images\ndescription: \"Selenium is built to mimic human action (e.g., clicking, typing, dragging, dropping, etc.).

We'll also want to add a helper method to capture the traffic and wire everything up with a central `run` method.\n\n```ruby\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\n  @proxy.close\nend\n\ndef capture_traffic\n  @proxy.new_har\n  yield\n  @proxy.har\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  @har = capture_traffic { yield }\n  teardown\nend\n```\n\nNow it's a simple matter of specifying the Selenium actions and outputting the HAR to a file.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/2'\n  @driver.find_element(css: '#start button').click\n  Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(timeout: 8).until do\n    @driver.find_element(css: '#finish')\n  end\nend\n\n@har.save_to './selenium.har'\n```\n\nIf we save this and run it (e.g., `ruby har.rb` from the command-line) it will launch the browser, run the Selenium commands, and create a new file called `selenium.har` (or overwrite it if there's one there already).\n\nNow we're ready to convert the HAR file to JMeter XML. To do that, we can use [the basic HAR converter](https://github.com/flood-io/ruby-jmeter/blob/master/examples/basic_har.rb) that is available in the examples of [the `ruby-jmeter` gem](https://github.com/flood-io/ruby-jmeter) (thanks to the fine folks at [flood.io](https://flood.io/)).\n\nWith a few modifications, it's ready for our needs.\n\n```ruby\n# filename: convert.rb\n\nrequire 'ruby-jmeter'\nrequire 'recursive-open-struct'\nrequire 'json'\nrequire 'pry-debugger'\n\nmodule HARtoJMX\n  def self.convert(file)\n    har = RecursiveOpenStruct.new(JSON.parse(File.open(file).read), recurse_over_arrays: true)\n\n    test do\n      cache\n\n      cookies\n\n      header [\n        { name: 'Accept-Encoding', value: 'gzip,deflate,sdch' },\n        { name: 'Accept', value: 'text/javascript, text/html, application/xml, text/xml, */*' }\n      ]\n\n      threads count: 1 do\n\n        har.log.entries.collect {|entry| entry.pageref }.uniq.each do |page|\n\n          transaction name: page do\n            har.log.entries.select {|request| request.pageref == page }.each do |entry|\n              next unless entry.request.url =~ /http/\n              params = entry.request.postData && entry.request.postData.params.collect {|param| [param.name, param.value] }.flatten\n              self.send entry.request.to_h.values.first.downcase, entry.request.url, fill_in: Hash[*params] do\n                with_xhr if entry.request.headers.to_s =~ /XMLHttpRequest/\n              end\n            end\n          end\n        end\n      end\n    end.jmx\n  end\nend\n```\n\nNow let's put it to use in our Selenium script.\n\n```ruby\n# filename: har.rb\n\n...\n\nHARtoJMX.convert 'selenium.har'\n# the default filename output is `jmeter.jmx`\n```\n\nAssuming you've [downloaded a copy of JMeter](http://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi) you're ready to run your load test.\n\nTo execute it from the command-line you'll need to specify the path to the JMeter binary executable, a couple of arguments, and the path to the JMX file.\n\n```sh\n./apache-jmeter-2.11/bin/jmeter -n -t ./jmeter.jmx\n```\n\n`-n` tells JMeter ot run in non-GUI mode, and `-t` is used to specify the path to the JMX file.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n+ Selenium runs the test in Firefox while connected to the proxy server\n+ The HTTP Archive (HAR) is exported to a file on disk\n+ The HAR file is converted to a JMeter XML (JMX) file\n+ JMeter is launched from the command-line and runs using the new JMX file\n\n## Summary\n\nAlternatively, you could open up the JMeter GUI, load the JMX file, and add on to it/reconfigure it/etc. This is a _much_ better place to start from since it saves you loads of up front busy work creating the load test from scratch.\n\nFrom here, it would be pretty trivial to add in a data set (e.g., [parameterize the test case](https://wiki.apache.org/jmeter/JMeterFAQ#How_do_I_parameterize_my_JMeter_test_cases.3F)), increase the number of concurrent users, and change all kinds of simulated user behavior.\n\nIf you go this route, be sure to take a look at the JMeter Wiki. It's got loads of good information.\n\nHappy Testing!\n\n"},84380:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'Load Testing Revisited'\nid: '68-load-testing-revisited'\nslug: /68-load-testing-revisited\nsidebar_label: Load Testing Revisited\ndescription: \"In [a previous tip](http://elementalselenium.com/tips/48-load-testing) I demonstrated a way to accomplish a simple load test with a Selenium script and an HTTP library.

The hardest part of using it is\nauthoring the test cases (e.g., in the JMeter GUI). Thankfully we can sidestep that by repurposing our Selenium\ntests into initial JMeter scripts. To do this we'll need a proxy server, the HTTP Archive (HAR) each test generates,\nand a HAR to JMeter XML (JMX) converter.\n\nWhen we're done, we'll have working JMeter test cases that we can modify and run (either from the GUI or the\ncommand-line).\n\nLet's dig in with an example.\n\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals.

We keep our setup, teardown, and run actions mostly the same.\nBut we change the base_url from an instance variable to an environment variable. Doing this will enable\nus to access it from anywhere in our test suite.\n\nWhile the usage of environment variables can be a slippery slope, this is an ideal candidate for it since\nit effects the overall behavior of the suite.\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rspec/expectations'\ninclude RSpec::Matchers\n\ndef setup\n  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox\n  ENV['base_url'] = 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/2'\nend\n\ndef teardown\n  @driver.quit\nend\n\ndef run\n  setup\n  yield\n  teardown\nend\n```\n\nNext we create a Page Object for the Dynamic Loading page by using a standard Ruby class and add some relevant\nbits to it.\n\nAt the top of it we pull out the CSS locators used in our test steps and put them into helpfully\nnamed constants to use instead. And instead of using the two part 'how', 'what' approach, we are\nusing a hash to store the locator type and its value.\n\nNext we use `attr_reader` to create a place to store the Selenium WebDriver instance for use throughout the class.\n\nThe class expects an argument (e.g. the Selenium WebDriver instance) which is received through the initialize method.\nInside the initialize method we take care of passing the Selenium object into the `attr_reader` object along with\nvisiting the page and verifying that we are in the correct place. All these things will execute in order when\nthis class is instantiated.\n\nWe then break out each of the test steps into methods that execute the behavior specific to the page while also\nswapping out the hard-coded CSS locators for our new CSS locator constant variables.\n\nAt the bottom of the class we have private helper methods. These methods aren't necessarily specific to the page\nthis class represents, but they are useful for it to function. So we want to access them within the class, but\nmake it so that they're not available outside the class. Using the private classification gets us this behavior nicely.\n\nAnd lastly, we update the `displayed?` private method to take a single argument for a 'locator' object (e.g. one of\nour CSS locator constant variables).\n\n```ruby\nclass DynamicLoading\n\n  START_BUTTON = { css: '#start button' }\n  FINISH_BUTTON = { css: '#finish' }\n\n  attr_reader :driver\n\n  def initialize(driver)\n    @driver = driver\n    visit\n    verify_page\n  end\n\n  def visit\n    driver.get ENV['base_url']\n  end\n\n  def start\n    driver.find_element(START_BUTTON).click\n  end\n\n  def finish_present?\n    wait_for { @driver.find_element(FINISH_BUTTON).displayed? }\n  end\n\n  def finish_text\n    driver.find_element(FINISH_BUTTON).text\n  end\n\n  private\n\n    def verify_page\n      expect(driver.title).to eql('The Internet')\n    end\n\n    def wait_for(seconds=10)\n      Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(:timeout => seconds).until { yield }\n    end\n\nend\n```\n\nWith our new Page Object in hand, our run action cleans up considerably. Making it more succinct and readable.\n\n```ruby\nrun do\n  dynamic_loading = DynamicLoading.new(@driver)\n  dynamic_loading.start\n  dynamic_loading.finish_present?\n  expect(dynamic_loading.finish_text).to eql('Hello World!')\nend\n```\n\nIt's worth noting that while we are peforming an assertion in the Page Object in our `verify_page`\naction __assertions should only be performed in your test scripts__ (just like the run action above).\nUsing a `verify_page` action is just a helpful exception to the rule.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n+ Load Dynamic Loading page on The Internet\n+ Click on start\n+ Wait for the finish message to appear\n+ Grab the text from it\n+ Assert that the text we want is within it\n\n## Summary\n\nHopefully this tip has helped you wade into the waters of Page Objects in Selenium.\n\nStay tuned for a future tip where we implement a Base Page Object class to abstract things even further\nand roll our own Domain Specific Language (DSL) for our test suite.\n\nUntil then, Happy Testing!\n"},64813:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'Use A Page Object'\nid: '7-use-a-page-object'\nslug: /7-use-a-page-object\nsidebar_label: Use A Page Object\ndescription: \"One of the biggest challenges with Selenium tests is that they can be brittle and challenging to maintain over time.\nThis is largely due to the fact that things in the app you're testing change, breaking your tests.\"\nnumber: 7\nhide_table_of_contents: true\nlevel: 2\npublish_date: 2013-07-09\ntags:\n  - 'page object'\n  - 'abstraction'\ncategory:\n  - 'tools'\n---\n\n# Using a Page Object\n\n## Intro\n\nOne of the biggest challenges with Selenium tests is that they can be brittle and challenging to maintain over time.\nThis is largely due to the fact that things in the app you're testing change, breaking your tests.\n\nBut the reality of a software project is that change is a constant.

You can follow him on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kwoding/).\nYou can also see a recording of him delivering this material at\nSauceCon ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACP6N1L62AU)).\n\nWhen most people start mobile testing, they tend to start with a few real devices and perform exploratory testing\nmanually. Over time, the number of devices grow, but in order to reach fast feedback and lessen the amount of\nmanual testing, a better usage of available tools is necessary.\n\n## A Solution\n\nMobile testing can be complex, and not only has to cover the UI aspects, but also compatibility of hardware, network connectivity, etc. A few examples of mobile testing challenges are:\n\n- Layout issues\n- Device incompatibility\n- OS issues\n- Network issues\n- Authentication issues\n\nBased on my personal mobile testing experience, I came up with the **Mobile Test Pyramid** strategy. Of course, it was inspired by the test pyramid of Mike Cohn ('Succeeding with Agile', 2009). But this doesn't quite cover the detail that is needed for a good mobile testing strategy.\n\nThe mobile test pyramid has 3 levels:\n\n- Real devices\n- Mobile simulators & emulators\n- Desktop browsers (using mobile simulation)\n\n\nIdentical to the generic test pyramid, the broader the layer in the pyramid, the more tests you should have which cover a wider range of complexity.\n\nHere are the focus areas for each layer, along with their pros and cons as I see them.\n\n### Desktop browsers: mobile testing on desktop browsers\n\n| Focus area                | Description                                                                |\n| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Functional system testing | Isolated browser tests performing full functional validations              |\n| Responsive design         | Resizing browsers and toggling user agents                                 |\n| Cross-browser             | Use equivalent desktop browsers                                            |\n| Overall visual layout     | No extensive visual checks because the rendering is different than devices |\n\n#### Pros\n\n- Fast execution: Matter of milliseconds to launch a browser, also headless execution is possible.\n- Scalable: Easily set up 10+ browser instances per machine.\n- Cross platform: Ability to use browsers on different operating systems.\n\n#### Cons\n\n- Mobile simulation uses the desktop browser engine: Mobile simulation in desktop browsers is still using the desktop browser.\n- No native integration: No native keyboards, incoming calls, etc.\n- Just not a device...

Emulators based on the Intel architecture are fast.\n- Debugging possibilities: Easy to debug simulator/emulators, already hooked up to the machine to access logs.\n\n#### Cons\n\n- Vanilla versions only: Manufacturer\u2019s skins are available, but the device behavior is still based on what comes stock.\n- No real resource usage: CPU/memory usage of machine in case of simulators. Emulators try to simulate the hardware.\n- No real interoperability: Connectivity with NFC, Bluetooth, network connections.\n- Slow ARM-based emulators: Emulators based on the ARM architecture are slow, which is the main architecture for Android devices.\n- Inaccurate color display in light/dark: Contrast/brightness inaccurate in light/dark environment.\n\n### Real devices: the real thing...\n\n| Focus area             | Description                                                                                        |\n| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Usability              | Validating usability such as actual click areas, touch actions and voice over                      |\n| Performance            | CPU/memory usage, battery, network strengths                                                       |\n| Native API integration | Interruption (incoming calls, push notifications), resource fighting (camera, GPS), NFC, Bluetooth |\n| Visuals                | Focus on devices which are not available as simulators/emulators                                   |\n| Manufacturer\u2019s sauce   | Real OS from manufacturers, e.g. Samsung's TouchWiz and built-in browsers                          |\n\n#### Pros\n\n- Native APIs in real conditions: Ability to test native APIs not only with injections for automation, but also actual NFC touch for example.\n- Can be faster than emulators: Some real devices are just faster than emulators due to the simulation of hardware, especially compared to the ARM-based emulators.\n- Just the real thing... Actual network conditions, battery/CPU/memory usage, manufacturer\u2019s secret sauce on top of the OS.\n\n#### Cons\n\n- Costs: Real devices come with a price, usually you pay per device/cradle.\n- New device means procurement: A new device is usually not available on-the-fly, even with cloud solutions. E.g. when the new iPhone comes out, it's not available immediately to procure. In the meantime, the iOS simulator would already be available.\n- Development iOS build required for automation: iOS apps need to be signed with Development Distribution Certificate and Provisioning Profile for automation.\n\n## Summary\n\nThere are loads of trade-offs when it comes to mobile testing. But by learning to use all layers of the mobile testing pyramid to your advantage (leveraging desktop browsers, mobile simulators/emulators, and real devices together) you can gain the fast feedback that is required in modern CI/CD environments. It's just a matter of focusing on the right things in each layer for your context.\n\n## About The Author\n\nKwo Ding is a hands-on test automation architect/consultant with over 10 years of experience in software testing.

Like all test scripts, first we will pull in the requisite libraries:\n\n```ruby\n# filename: headless_chrome.rb\nrequire 'selenium-webdriver'\nrequire 'rspec/expectations'\ninclude RSpec::Matchers\n```\n\nNow we can create our `setup` method where we will pass Chrome our headless options as command line arguments.\n\n```ruby\ndef setup\n    options = Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome::Options.new\n    options.add_argument('--headless')\n    options.add_argument('--disable-gpu')\n    options.add_argument('--remote-debugging-port=9222')\n    @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :chrome, options: options\nend\n```\n\nThe first `add_argument` of `'-- headless'` allows us to run Chrome in headless mode. The second argument is, [according to Google](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome), temporarily required to work around a few known bugs. The third argument is optional but gives us the ability to debug our application in another browser if we need to (using localhost:9222).\n\nNow let's finish our test by creating our `teardown` and `run` methods.\n\n```ruby\ndef teardown\n    @driver.quit\nend\n\ndef run\n    setup\n    yield\n    teardown\nend\n\nrun do\n    @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com'\n    expect(@driver.title).to eql 'The Internet'\n    @driver.save_screenshot('headless.png')\nend\n```\n\nHere we are loading a page, asserting on the title (to make sure we are in the right place), and taking a screenshot to make sure our headless setup is working correctly.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen we save our file and run it (e.g. `ruby headless_chrome.rb`) here is what will happen:\n\n- A headless chrome browser instance will open\n- Test runs and captures a screenshot\n- Browser closes\n\n## Summary\n\nHopefully this tip has helped you get your tests running smoothly locally (or on your CI Server). This is the best option since it's easy to setup, officially supported by the browser vendor, and has a consistent rendering experience to what an end-user would experience in a full instance of Chrome.\n\nHappy Testing!\n\n## About The Author\n\nChris Kenst is a Software Quality advocate, Test Engineer, [occasional blogger](http://kenst.com), and maintainer of an open source list of software testing\nconferences ([link](http://testingconferences.org)).

And the rest of the class is filled with a series of common Selenium actions that we pull from the GoogleSearch Page Object.\n\n```ruby\nclass Base\n\n  attr_reader :driver\n\n  def initialize(driver)\n    @driver = driver\n  end\n\n  def visit(url='/')\n    driver.get(ENV['base_url'] + url)\n  end\n\n  def find(locator)\n    driver.find_element locator\n  end\n\n  def clear(locator)\n    find(locator).clear\n  end\n\n  def type(locator, input)\n    find(locator).send_keys input\n  end\n\n  def click_on(locator)\n    find(locator).click\n  end\n\n  def displayed?(locator)\n    driver.find_element(locator).displayed?\n    true\n    rescue Selenium::WebDriver::Error::NoSuchElementError\n      false\n  end\n\n  def text_of(locator)\n    find(locator).text\n  end\n\n  def title\n    driver.title\n  end\n\n  def wait_for(seconds=5)\n    Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(:timeout => seconds).until { yield }\n  end\n\nend\n```\n\nWith the Base class in hand we simply update the GoogleSearch Page Object to inherit from it (with `< Base` after the class name) and wire it up and clean things up.\n\nSince we have some actions we want to execute when we load the GoogleSearch object, we keep them in the `initialize` method. But since we are inheriting from the Base class we need to call `super` before them. This is responsible for passing the driver object into the Base class and making all of its methods run smoothly.\n\n```ruby\nclass GoogleSearch < Base\n\n  SEARCH_BOX        = { name: 'q' }\n  TOP_SEARCH_RESULT = { css: '#rso .g' }\n\n  def initialize(driver)\n    super(driver)\n    visit('/')\n    verify_page\n  end\n\n  def search_for(search_term)\n    type SEARCH_BOX, search_term\n    find(SEARCH_BOX).send_keys(:enter)\n  end\n\n  def search_result_present?(search_result)\n    wait_for { displayed?(TOP_SEARCH_RESULT) }\n    text_of(TOP_SEARCH_RESULT).include? search_result\n  end\n\n  private\n\n    def verify_page\n      expect(driver.title).to include ('Google')\n    end\n\nend\n```\n\nOnce that's done, we'll add our actual test script.\n\n```ruby\nrun {\n  google = GoogleSearch.new(@driver)\n  google.search_for 'elemental selenium tips'\n  result = google.search_result_present? 'Elemental Selenium'\n  expect(result).to be == true\n}\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n+ Load Google\n+ Search for _elemental selenium tips_\n+ Wait for the first search result to render\n+ Grab the text from it\n+ Assert that the text we want is within it\n\n## Summary\n\nNow we are in a position to write more Page Objects that leverage common actions without duplication or any Selenium code directly in them.\n\nHopefully this tip has helped you find your way further down the rabbit hole of Page Objects (in a good way).\n\nHappy Testing!\n"},31929:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.r(n),t.d(n,{default:()=>r});const r="---\ntitle: 'Use A Base Page Object'\nid: '9-use-a-base-page-object'\nslug: /9-use-a-base-page-object\nsidebar_label: Use A Base Page Object\ndescription: \"In a previous tip, we went through creating a simple Page Object to capture the behavior of a page we were interacting with.

While this was a good start, it leaves a lot of room for improvement. One of the biggest issues is that there\nare common actions we will likely need across multiple Page Objects and, with our current approach, we would end up\nwith duplicate code.\n\nAnother issue is that we are using Selenium actions directly in the Page Object, which could present some long-term\nimpacts like, such as:\n+ the inability to drive your tests with a different driver\n+ test maintenance issues when Selenium actions change\n+ slower test writing due to the lack of a Domain Specific Language (DSL)\n\n## A Solution\n\nWith a Base Page Object (a.k.a. a facade layer) we can abstract all common actions into a central location and\nleverage them in any Page Object we see fit.\n\n\nimport DisplayTips from '@site/src/components/displayTips';\n\n<DisplayTips languages={[\n    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},\n]}/>\n\n\n## About The Author\n\nDave Haeffner is the original writer of Elemental Selenium -- a free, once weekly Selenium tip newsletter that's read\nby thousands of testing professionals.
